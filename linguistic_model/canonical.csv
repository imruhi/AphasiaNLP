So i have two children.
One of my children is adopted.
So i already told the story about my son being born.
So i guess we can talk about my daughter and the adoption.
We tried to have children for many years and could not get pregnant.
We went through lots of fertility treatments and did not they did not really find anything that would because us not to get pregnant.
But i was bound and determined to be a mom.
So then we started pursuing the adoption route.
Very interesting i never thought how complicated it was to do that and and all that goes into that.
We went through a domestic adoption agency here in south carolina and actually had a couple birth mothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute.
So you know we always say we were just waiting for her.
And of course she always tells her brother that she was the chosen one because we chose her.
We did not have any choice with him.
He is just what we got.
So you know i think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different because i gave birth to a child.
Also i adopted a child.
I think it gave me interesting insight to both sides of it.
There is certainly pros and cons to both ways to becoming a mom as well.
But you know a lot of people say.
It would not feel like my own child.
There is no difference between them.
So is interesting too because she says that she wants to adopt when she is ready to start a family.
That she would like to adopt a child from the foster system.
So i think that is kind of interesting her perspective on that.
The little boy was playing soccer in his yard.
One time he kicked it a little bit too hard.
He kicked it through his front window.
His dad was sitting in the living room.
The ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp.
The dad stood up got the ball and looked out the window and glared at his little boy.
So the little boy was getting ready to go to school.
His mother said.
Johnny you need to take an umbrella.
It is going to rain today.
He said.
I do not need an umbrella.
He left.
Sure enough as he got halfway to school it started raining.
Then it started raining harder.
So he turned around.
He went back home and told his mom.
It started raining.
So he ended up taking the umbrella and walking back to school.
So the little girl was riding along on her tricycle in her yard.
She was playing with her cat and her dog.
All of a sudden the dog chased the cat up the tree.
She called for her dad.
She said.
Dad sparky has chased peanut up the tree.
So the dad said.
Well let me see if i can go get the cat.
So sparky's still barking at the base of the tree.
Dad climbed up the tree.
But he could not reach the cat.
Finally the mom called the fire department because she did not know how to get the dad or the cat out of the tree.
So the fire fighters came with their ladder.
They are rushing to the scene so they can rescue both the dad and the cat from the tree.
So when cinderella was a little girl her mom passed away.
Her father remarried another woman who had two daughters.
So as they grew up they asked cinderella to do all the chores around the house.
She did not get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did.
So one day they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess.
But the stepmother and stepsisters said.
Oh well you cannot go to the ball because you have nothing to wear.
So cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years.
When her stepsisters saw it they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together.
The stepsisters went off to the ball.
She said.
Oh well you can go to the ball.
She turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters.
Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball.
She danced with the prince and had a wonderful time.
But remember that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were.
So she noticed that it was about to strike midnight.
She tore away from the prince and ran away and got home just in time before everything turned back to what they were.
But she realized that she had dropped her slipper on the stairs.
And but the other slipper stayed the same.
So she kept it because she had wonderful memories from the ball.
Later that week the prince wanted to find the beautiful woman who he had danced with throughout the evening.
He took the glass slipper that he found on the stairs and went around to every single woman in the village to see if he could find who it belonged to.
So the stepmother locked cinderella in her attic room because she had a feeling that that was her.
The prince came to their house and tried the slipper on the stepsisters.
But it did not fit them.
Cinderella's animal friends slipped her a key under the crack of the door.
He tried the glass slipper on cinderella.
It fit.
He realized that she was the woman that he had danced with.
Then they got married and lived happily ever after.
We use this one too.
First you get two pieces of bread.
You get a jar of peanut butter.
You spread some peanut butter on one slice of bread.
You get a jar of jelly.
You spread the jelly on the other piece of the bread.
You put the two pieces together.
Then you can eat it.
I will tell a different story.
I have lots of stories.
I think all speech pathologists have lots of stories right.
Let me talk about when i went to belgium as a cultural exchange student which was i would say kind of life changing.
When i graduated from undergraduate school i went to bowling green state university in ohio.
I had the opportunity to travel as part of the international foreign youth exchange which is a fourh associated organization.
I was big in in fourh when i was young bebecause i grew up in ohio.
But anyway i had the opportunity.
Ohio the state of ohio sends several people every year to go to a foreign country.
We had people stay with us when i was growing up.
So i always knew that i wanted to do that.
Since i had taken french all through high school i thought.
Ah well i will go to a french speaking country.
So i chose belgium.
Luckily i got to go there.
I soon found out that learning high school french was not what they were speaking in belgium.
So it took a lot longer to be able to communicate.
But it was really interesting in that i kind of experienced what it is like not to be able to communicate very well because the families that i was placed in.
Most of them did not speak any english.
So i had to learn french.
That is the best way to learn it i think.
But i when i say it was life changing it really kind of made me think about first of all that other people are not like us in the united states.
Really got me thinking about how can i do what i do as a speech pathologist in other countries.
So i immediately came home and interviewed with the department of defense because i wanted to be an international speech pathologist.
They said.
Well you got to get your master's degree.
Back then you you did not have to have your master's degree in in a lot of settings to work.
"So that is when i came to the university of south carolina to get my master's and met my husband , got married , had children."
I had a private practice when i was teaching as a full time professor and did some a lot of international work that way.
So i was doing telepractice before it was cool actually.
I have got to work with people around the country.
I did accent modification and and that kind of thing.
I still love to travel.
I still keep in touch with my some of my host families in belgium.
We have hosted kids from other countries for for other programs as well.
I always encourage my children i hope they will if not study abroad then travel a little bit more than i did growing up.
So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard.
All of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window.
His dad was in the living room when the ball came through.
It knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad.
So the little boy was getting ready to go to school when his mother said.
Oh you definitely need to take your umbrella today.
They are calling for rain.
The little boy said.
I do not need my umbrella today.
It will not rain on me.
So he is walking to school.
Of course it started to sprinkle.
Then it started to rain even harder.
The boy was getting soaked.
So the boy turned around and went back home and told his mother.
I needed my umbrella.
She gave him his umbrella.
He turned around and went back to school.
So the little girl was playing in her yard riding her tricycle when all of a sudden a dog ran into the yard and chased her cat up the tree.
She was very upset because she could not get her cat down.
So she yelled for her dad who was in the house to see if he could help.
So he tried to cut climb up the tree and get the cat.
The dog continued to bark at the base of the tree.
The next thing that happened was the little girl's mother called the fire department to see if they could come and help.
So the firefighters came with their ladder.
They are heading to the tree as well.
So cinderella went to live with her stepmother and stepsisters when she was very small.
Her father had become a widow widower and went to live with his new wife.
The father passed away.
Cinderella was left to live with her stepmother and evil stepsisters.
They did not treat cinderella very well at always asking her to do things around the house.
Whereas the stepsisters were very spoiled and got to do whatever they wanted.
One day the prince in the village sent out a declaration that he was looking for a princess.
He was going to have a ball.
He invited all of the young women in the village to come to the ball.
Cinderella overheard and really wanted to go to the ball as well.
Of course she did not have anything to wear to the ball.
But then she found something upstairs in the attic where she could perhaps make her own ball gown.
So with the help of her animal friends she made a beautiful ballgown with the things that she could find.
She put the ball gown on.
When the stepsisters saw her in that ball gown they became so angry that she thought that she was going to go to the ball.
They ripped the the ball gown from cinderella and tore it up.
Later that evening her fairy godmother came along and made her a beautiful gown and turned her animal friends into horses and attendants who could take her in a carriage made out of a pumpkin to the ball.
She just told her that the only thing that she hadta remember about the spell was that she hadta be home by midnight.
That was when everything was going to go back the way it was.
So she went to the ball and met the prince.
The prince was enchanted by her.
They danced the evening.
When the clock struck twelve she suddenly remembered that she hadta be home.
So she ran away from the prince leaving a glass slipper on the steps.
She made it home.
Everything turned back into the way it was before.
She was just happy that she had the experience that she had with the prince.
She also had the one glass slipper.
The next day the prince was trying to find the woman who he danced with.
So he went around to all the young women in the village to see who would fit into the glass slipper.
The evil stepsisters tried and tried to get the slipper to fit on their feet.
But it would not fit.
They had locked cinderella in the attic because they did not want her to see the prince.
But her animal friends helped her get out of the attic.
She came down and turned out that the glass slipper did fit her.
So she went off with the prince and married the prince and lived happily ever after.
So first i would get some bread and get the peanut butter and get the jelly.
On a plate i would put one slice of bread and spread some peanut butter on that slice of bread.
Then i would put it together and then eat it.
Let us see.
Let us go with something professional.
So i used to run iu's writing center which worked with students undergraduates and graduates.
At the request of a couple of deans i started a women's writing group just as an experiment.
They took off like wildfire.
As a result these grew and grew until there were so many of them that i could not do them as a side gig.
So the provost's office bought me out and started the scholarly writing program which i now run.
I love this job.
That is really important bebecause i was really not liking my job in the writing center.
He kicks it.
It goes through the window looks like of a living room and hits a lamp.
He gets up with the soccer ball and looks out the window presumably to yell at the little soccer player.
So looks like a little boy is heading out to school because he has his backpack.
His mother wants him to take an umbrella because she probably thinks it is going to rain.
He says no.
He says goodbye and heads outside where it starts to rain.
He is dismayed.
So he runs back home.
He is disappointed bebecause he is soaking wet.
His mother looks disappointed too.
But he leaves again maybe in different clothes.
I cannot tell.
The beginning is that a cat was chased up a tree by a dog perhaps.
I assume that is her dad in the tree and that the cat is theirs.
Looks like the dad climbed up the tree on a ladder to get the cat.
He did not make it to the cat.
The ladder fell.
The dog is still barking.
The girl still wants her cat which is still up in the tree.
The firemen are now coming we hope to rescue the cat.
Why there is a bird in the tree i do not know.
Why there is a tricycle i assume it goes with the little girl.
So let us hope it has a happy ending.
That the firemen wind up getting the cat out of the tree and the dad out of the tree now.
Cinderella's father remarries a woman with two daughters.
There is an announcement from the king prince must marry.
An invitation comes to the family.
But cinderella who is friendly with the mice and the animals around who help her because she is sad because they are mean to her she is not allowed to go let us say.
That is what they call them.
Cinderella remains behind.
But her fairy godmother comes along and helps her with.
She is sent off to the ball.
Although it is not in the picture she is supposed to come back by midnight when all the magic ends.
She goes to the ball.
She gets to dance with the prince.
They have a lovely time.
But she realizes midnight is approaching.
She runs.
She leaves behind a slipper.
The prince finds it and goes then after that searching for the girl whose glass slipper it is.
It is discovered that it fits cinderella even though the evil stepsisters try it on.
They cut the toes off to make the shoe fit.
Anyway the shoe fits her.
Cinderella and the prince get married and live happily ever after supposedly.
Did you say peanut butter and jelly or peanut butter?
I would take two pieces of bread out of the package that i keep in the refrigerator.
I would spread peanut butter on one side with a knife.
I would spoon jelly onto the other side with a spoon.
I never stick the peanut butter knife in the jelly.
I am the chair of our reunion which has of course has been postponed.
So we have been doing all kinds of things online which is as you know fun but complicated.
So so tonight for example we are having this like cocktail party.
Anyway so i am thinking a lot about college.
The thing that is been important to me about college and the reason i volunteer so much of my time for it is that i went to a rural suburban high school in ohio that was focused primarily on sports.
There was not much for me to do in my high school.
You know academics were not stressed at all.
I mean no ap classes.
So when i got to college it was a revelation that here are all of these people my age who were similarly interested in reading and in books and in travel and things that most of my friends from high school were not particularly interested in.
I think i remain to this day the only woman from my high school to ever get a doctorate.
So that is one of the reasons i continue to contribute as a volunteer.
Anyway that is a happy thought bebecause it is now i just zoomed with my three best friends last night bebecause one of ththem just retired.
You know we met our first day college.
I do not know.
It goes through a window a big window.
When it goes through the window it crashes into someone is house where a man is sitting.
It breaks a lamp.
Man gets up with the ball looks out the window i am assuming to see who kicked it and probably to yell at them.
First frame little boy's mother is offering him an umbrella.
I am assuming she knows that it might rain that day.
But he is shaking her off.
He says goodbye without his umbrella.
She is still holding it looking stern.
When he gets outside lo and behold it is raining pretty hard looks like.
He runs back home soaking wet and disappointed.
I assume that his mother's saying.
I told you so.
He heads back out i hope in dry clothes with an umbrella this time.
Somehow a cat got up a tree.
That started this whole mess.
The little girl's trying wants the cat out of the tree.
It looks to me like the dog chased the cat up the tree.
It appears that the what i assume is the dad climbed up into the tree to get the cat down.
The ladder has fallen.
So he cannot get down from the tree either.
Someone called the the firemen.
They are here we hope to rescue both the dad and the cat which i hope makes the little girl happy.
I am not sure why the bird is there just for verisimilitude i guess.
He remarries a woman who has two daughters who become cinderella's stepsisters.
They put cinderella to work.
She in the disney version is befriended by the little mice.
So anyway cinderella is a scullery maid essentially to the family.
Meanwhile the king of the kingdom announces that his son should marry.
They announce a ball to which cinderella's family are invited.
Yes they invite all the eligible women in the kingdom.
I would forgotten that part til i saw the picture again this time.
So she is left without a ballgown.
They leave her behind and go off to the ball without her.
But she is rescued by her fairy godmother who creates a dress for her and changes a pumpkin into a carriage.
I think the mice are the ones that become the footmen.
Off cinderella goes to the ball with the admonition that she has to be done by midnight because all of the magic will end then.
So she goes to the ball.
They dance.
The clock starts to strike twelve.
Then she runs out of the ball to get in her coach and leave.
She leaves behind a slipper a glass slipper it is in the disney version.
She gets home.
Of course everything returns to the pumpkin it was.
Or sometime the prince is looking for the girl who dropped her slipper because s the girl he loves.
They go about having every girl who is in the kingdom try the shoe on.
It does not fit the stepsisters.
Everyone is shocked in the household when it fits cinderella.
So she and the prince marry and you know traditionally live happily ever after.
I just did that yesterday.
"I begin with two pieces of bread , wheat bread."
I spread jelly on one side.
I always do the jelly first as i said before so that you do not contaminate the jelly with peanut butter.
Then i spread the jelly on one piece of bread face up and peanut butter on the other side.
Then i put them together and cut them in half diagonally.
Alright so i once went to a train station to buy a ticket for my mother who was wanting to go back from from town a to to a capital of the country in argentina.
My mother wanted to travel the next day.
So i went to buy a ticket for the next day.
There was a long line of people waiting to buy tickets for the next day.
But then at the other end of the hall there was a line for people returning tickets.
So i found that if you were returning a ticket for the next twenty four hours you got sixty percent knocked off the price.
You only got forty percent of your money back.
So i found somebody who was going to return tickets for the next day.
I said.
Look they are going to discount sixty percent.
They said.
I said.
Well you can check the information office.
So this person checked and yes.
So i said.
I will give you forty percent that you are going to get back and save you the waiting time.
She said.
So i bought my mother's ticket at forty percent.
Then i said.
I bought this ticket.
There is a whole line of people waiting to buy a ticket for tomorrow.
There was a specific line tickets for tomorrow.
So i could buy another ticket and then sell it.
So yeah i started doing that until somebody came and said.
So i was doing that for tomorrow and for the day after.
So i bought them at whatever discount the office gave and then sold them at the regular price.
But i had my my pockets full of tickets.
Then one person came and said.
Do you have tickets for tomorrow?
I said.
I even had different categories.
Do you want first or tourist or first class or whatever?
He said.
Do you have tickets for the day after tomorrow?
I said.
I have got tickets for any day you want.
He says.
Well then you are arrested because this is railway police.
So he arrested me.
He did not handcuff me.
But he said.
You need to give me all your tickets.
That was my big mistake because i should have said.
No you can arrest me if you want.
But i want these tickets to remain in my possession.
I bought them.
They do not have a name.
So i was shaking.
I never had been arrested before or after that incident.
So i gave him all the tickets.
When he had all the tickets he said.
I will let you know what to do.
Of course he left me standing in the middle of the big hall.
I did not have my ticket.
But i did not want to be arrested.
I did not want to go to jail.
I did not know what the consequences of what i had done could be.
So i bolted.
I did not stop running for five hundred meters which is probably what this person wanted me to do anyway.
So yeah i lost my ticket.
But with with what i made before i was arrested i bought my first motorcycle.
They were getting them at at a discount.
I do not know if it was even a a written law anywhere that they should discount it so heavily.
Of course they were just getting it to the other side.
We were living there for a while.
And i was staying at a friend's house in miramar which was about forty five minutes away and driving back to monte plata to do the business and then going back to the other seaside resort.
But at least you know i did it until they saw this guy coming everyday you know.
What is he doing?
Oh he is selling a ticket.
No wonder we do not get such a long line.
He is taking the business.
So this goes back to a time when my brother sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's house.
But he did not want us playing ball in our backyard which would be very close to his house.
So what was supposed to happen.
I told sam know one day one of us is going to kick the ball into into our neighbor's window.
So we are going to kick the ball into mortimer's window.
We are going to be in trouble.
He said no.
We should not worry about that.
Okay i went with it until the day came when sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's mortimer's window.
So it went on into into the house.
Not only did it break the window it also knocked over a lamp that mister mortimer had told us was a very very dear object in his house that had a history of family inheritance and heirloom that i cannot quite remember.
But i do remember how much he appreciated the lamp.
So we were both frozen when we saw mortimer look through the hole that sam had just put in the window.
I cannot tell you what the consequences were.
But i do remember that we had a very very hard time after that incident.
I remember my aunt charlotte.
I did not like her at all.
I remember staying at her house one day.
For some reason we were not allowed to stay home because the painters had just finished painting.
They did not want us to to sleep where where there was paint fresh paint smell around.
So i stayed at aunt charlotte's.
Well lo and behold the next day it turns out that there was a rainy day.
So i am going to go to school which was a much longer walk from aunt charlotte's house than it was from my house.
It was raining.
So i said.
Hey aunt charlotte can i please borrow your umbrella.
She said no.
Which i knew she was going to say no because that is how wicked she was.
So i went out in the rain and eventually realized that i was going to get flu.
We did not have coronavirus in those days.
But i was going to get the flu.
So i said.
I am walking to school.
I am going to end up being sick.
So i decided that this was not going to work the way it was.
I started to go back home.
I arrived back.
I said.
Aunt charlotte do you want to be responsible for my illness and perhaps death?
She said.
No no no no i do not want to be sued for that.
So she lent me her umbrella.
I walked back to school with aunt charlotte's umbrella.
What we are seeing is what happened in my neighborhood about i would say about a year ago.
Daisy was playing with her cat kitty cat.
Kitty cat decided to climb the tree.
Daisy wanted to get the cat to come back.
But the cat would not go down.
So therefore her dad decided to rescue the cat.
He went up as far as the first branch where you see him sitting down and then was in total distress.
So they in in the meantime our dog cooper started to bark at my dad bebecause i am daisy's brother.
So cooper started to bark at dad because cooper wanted dad to come back.
Daisy wanted the cat to come back.
Cooper wanted my dad to come back off the tree.
I had the the cold mind and and criterion because my mother was all up in arms.
She was running like a chicken with his head cut off and not knowing what to do.
So they had to rely on me to say look this situation called a fire brigade.
Noone can help us.
I am not going to climb your tree.
I hate the cat on the other hand.
So i am not going to rescue the cat.
I i wanted cooper to feel better.
I i i mean i have a stronger relationship to cooper than to anybody else in this picture including the bird.
I hate birds.
I hate cats.
But i i i like my dad.
I like my sister sorta.
But even though i hate cats.
So i call the fire brigade and saw the fire brigade eventually came and rescued the cat helped my dad to come back.
Cooper was settled down dog house.
Everything went back to the peace that everything started with.
I gave myself a bar of chocolate for being the person with the most common sense in the whole family.
So once upon a time there was a very wicked lady who had three daughters.
One day her husband i think adopted or or brought in a new child into the house.
Or the the the three sisters did not like the new child.
They commanded her to do all kinds of menial work and tasks and do their laundry and sweep the floors.
But she consoled herself and her friendship with animals.
So what love she did not get from the sisters in the household she got from the little creatures that surrounded her every day when she was going about her tasks.
Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold hole hold a ball.
And the household was invited to the ball.
So cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited.
But her sisters told her different.
Furthermore they told her that she was not not only not invited but she was not appropriately dressed and did not have a dress that would suit the occasion.
So they left for the ball.
What would you like to do my child?
She says.
I would like to go to the ball.
So but i do not have a dress.
The fairy said.
We can whip up a dress with my magic wand.
Cinderella had herself this magnificent dress and it a very nice pair of shoes.
Not only that but also a carriage that was going to take her to the ball.
So she goes to the ball and impresses everybody including the the prince the the king's son who falls desperately in love with her.
But the fairy had said.
You must be back by midnight or you are going to turn into a pumpkin.
So the prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry.
So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe.
They had to find the person whom the shoe fit perfect.
They went to the sisters.
Even the mother tried her luck.
But the shoe did not fit.
So no candidate was found to marry the prince until one of the animals told the surveyor that she should try cinderella.
"When the surveyor did that , the shoe fit cinderella perfectly."
So the prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from all.
He lives happily ever after.
So you get two slices of bread.
Then you you need a peanut butter jar with peanut butter in it and a knife.
You also need a jar of jelly with jelly in it.
So you put the two slices on the table.
"You dip your knife into the peanut butter , get it out a big chunk and schmear it over one of the slices of bread."
Then you do likewise with the jelly on the other slice.
Then you put the two slices with the schmear together.
So in nineteen eighty four i applied and received a scholarship to do my master's degree at depauw university in greencastle indiana.
During the first week having arrived even before classes started which was just orientation etcetera etcetera i found out that the panam games were going to come to indianapolis in nineteen eighty seven.
So i immediately applied for a job with the panam games that took the whole duration of my master's degree to materialize.
But eventually in eighty six appointed vice president of international relations with the panam games.
As such i traveled extensively with the president of the panam games organizing committee including a trip to cuba to meet with fidel castro and offer conditions that would satisfy him for cuba to participate in the panam games in indianapolis of eighty seven the tenth pan american games.
So essentially we offered that the athletes would not have to receive a visa.
Anybody who got on the plane came to the games.
That the plane would fly directly from havana to indianapolis.
That they would get a preferential area of the pan american village to house their athletes.
Finally that the united states would lend every support they could to the organization of the nineteen ninety one games in havana.
So those were the four conditions that the cubans requested.
We said yes to everything.
We are not the pan american sports organization who is ultimately the one that decides where the next games are going to be played.
So so cuba agreed to participate.
I was the one person that got called from the cuban olympic committee confirming that they were going to participate.
That was very thrilling because for a few minutes i was the only one that knew that cuba was going to participate in the panam games which was a a very sought after objective.
It was what every everybody wanted.
I was the only person in the organization that knew about it because i was acting as interpreter between the cubans and the organizing committee in indy.
The cubans participated.
The panam games went to cuba in nineteen ninety one.
But then in ninety five i met cubans again because they came as consultants participation in the pan american games in argentina.
So i took part in the organization of that pan american games given my experience with the indianapolis games.
I met with several of the same players that had taken part in that participation of cuba in the indianapolis games.
You know it was my job.
But what a job you know.
I wish i could find such a job now.
This is the story about the time when i was kicking a ball in our yard.
It went into our neighbor's window.
So when i sent the ball crashing through his window i thought he was going to be mad.
But eventually i did.
He said.
Look i will let you go without any punishment if you write a short essay for me.
That is how i started writing.
I felt so much love of writing that ever since i have become a writer.
I have not been published.
But i have a lot of writings that started with that incident that mister jenkins induced after i broke his window.
I remember spending a night in her house because of the pandemic.
We were caught by a lockdown in her house.
I did not attend school.
But i did go to a tutor's house because of course there were no schools.
But one day i was getting ready to go my tutor's home who was doing supplementary work so that i would not miss out on school that was cancelled.
So i asked my aunt charlotte for an umbrella.
But she said.
No i am not going to let you use my umbrella.
So then i had to walk out in the rain without an umbrella and realized two things.
One that i was getting wet which was not comfortable.
I did not like that.
The second one that i had a very good excuse to get a hold of the umbrella.
So i went back to my aunt charlotte.
I said.
Look i could get ill.
Who knows?
I could catch corona virus because of getting ill.
So the only way to prevent this is by you lending me your umbrella.
So she gave me the umbrella.
Alright so i remember this incident very very clearly.
My sister would not lend me her tricycle.
So what i thought i would do is make her switch her attention to the cat.
So i put the cat on top of the tree.
She immediately left her tricycle the way you see it now.
But before i could grab it which is all that i was looking for she started creating such a scandal about the cat being on top of the tree that my dad got involved.
He tried to climb the tree to get cat off the tree.
Then the dog started barking at my dad bebecause the dog went wanted my dad to come off the tree.
Eventually my mother had such a fit over the whole incident that she called the fire brigade to to get everybody back the cat back to my sister my dad back to the ground.
After chaos i ended up not being able to use the tricycle because i had created disruption of our home life that i guess i got my punishment in the act of trying to get what i wanted.
One day somebody asks her to adopt this new girl who was an orphan.
Could she stay with the mother and the two daughters?
The mother says yes.
But far from incorporating the new daughter to her daily life she and the two daughters task her with the most menial tasks and and make her do the laundry and iron the sheets and clean and wash.
They do not let her participate in in their daily lives.
So one day the ruler of the land sends news that he is going to organize a big ball and that all the inhabitants of the county are invited.
So of course the two sisters get very very excited.
She wants to go too.
But on the night of the ball she shows up with a very simple dress.
The two sisters tell her that is totally inappropriate.
She cannot go to a ball with that dress.
So cinderella is in great distress as the sisters depart for the ball.
Lo and behold here comes the fairy godmother and gives cinderella a splendid dress and a carriage to take her to the ball.
But she must come back before twelve of the clock midnight or she is going to turn into a pumpkin.
So cinderella goes to the ball and dances with the prince who falls madly in love with cinderella.
But she must leave in haste at twelve midnight before she turns into a pumpkin.
In departing the ball in such a hurry she drops one of her shoes.
One of her shoes comes off her foot and is left behind.
So then she goes home and goes back to her menial tasks and sharing a lot with the little mice and the horses and the other sheep and those farm animals maybe including sheep or pigs or whatever that form the household.
Until one day she catches news that somebody is looking for the owner of her shoe because the prince wants to find the owner that madly fell in love at the ball.
So both her sisters try the shoe.
But the shoe will not fit until cinderella tries the shoe on.
She proves that she is the owner of the shoe.
The prince gets in touch with her probably not by email but by some other means of the time.
Eventually they get married and live happily ever after.
Alright first of all i would check that i have the ingredients which would be two slices of bread and a jar of peanut butter and a jar of grape jelly usually.
But any marmalade will do.
Orange jelly will do.
Then i put both slices on the table.
If it is going to be for me i will put peanut butter on both slices and then spread the jelly on both slices.
Then put one slice on top of the other so that the peanut butter and jelly sides face each other.
So then you do not get your hands dirty with a sandwich.
So that is how you make a sandwich.
In february of twenty eighteen my first granddaughter was born to my daughter who is the cognitive scientist at johns hopkins.
We we spend as much as we can.
But we do do what we do online talking on the phone video calls two or three times a week.
So we get to keep communicating.
Firstnameb was in you know with child.
The twenty fifth of february firstnameb started having some labor pains.
So firstnames her husband called us and said.
We are going to the hospital.
We are just going to get her checked out and make sure everything's okay with the baby.
Well i said.
Cool we will we will talk to you later or tomorrow whenever.
At about three of the clock in the morning my cellphone rang.
Fortunately for me i had my ringer on.
I usually turn my ringer off at night.
I picked it up.
I said.
He says.
So i was able to message that the baby was born.
We would have missed it if i would have had my ringer off.
Jimmy was playing soccer in the front yard and kicked the ball.
It came right through the window and hit a lamp which startled mister jones.
He picked up the ball and went to the window and yelled at jimmy to come here.
I wanted you to pay for this window.
His mother said.
You should take an umbrella because it is going to rain.
He said.
Nah i do not need an umbrella.
So he walked out the door.
On his way to school it started raining.
He got soaking wet.
"He ran back home , talked to his mom."
His mom said.
See i told you you should have taken the umbrella.
So she gave him the umbrella.
He walked the rest of the way to school with an umbrella.
The cat saw a bird singing in the tree.
The a dog chased the cat up the tree.
The little girl wanted her cat.
So she asked her daddy to get the cat out of the tree.
Daddy climbed up in the tree and got stuck and could not get to the cat.
So they had to call the fire department to come rescue him.
They came.
They got ladders.
They are now going to put the ladders up to get him down from the tree.
They will probably also get the cat down.
When cinderella was a young girl her mother had passed away.
So her father decided to marry who a woman who became her stepmother who also had two daughters that would be her stepsisters.
They have a mean old cat.
So cinderella moved in.
Then as they grew up the stepsisters made cinderella do all the the dirty chores.
She had to clean the floors had to clean the chimney everything like that.
But she did her job.
She wanted to keep her dad and happy because you know he had already lost one wife.
So one day in the castle the king was talking to his righthand man and told him that he wanted his son to get married so he would have an heir to the throne.
Which i cannot remember the title for i am just going to call him the righthand man.
Went to all the houses in the village and gave them an invitation to a grand ball for all the girls eligible bachelorettes to go to the ball of course being escorted by their parents.
Well cinderella read the letter over her stepmother's shoulder and got excited because she thought.
Wow i can go.
So cinderella went and started to to make a dress.
She the she had the mice that were making dresses for her because hers was not very pretty.
She wanted a pretty dress.
So they made her a pretty dress.
The night of the ball came.
She put on her pretty dress and went to where her stepmother and her stepsisters were waiting.
The stuffsisters sisters were not happy that cinderella was even thinking about going.
So they ripped her dress and ripped her necklace took her and messed up her hair and said.
You cannot go.
So after that cinderella went out into the garden.
She was crying because she really wanted to go.
She felt betrayed.
So all of a sudden up pops her fairy godmother.
Her fairy godmother says.
Well i can solve your problem.
We will make it a magic dress.
She waves a magic wand.
She has a beautiful dress.
She waves a magic wand and turns a pumpkin and all the mice into the chariot and then footmen and everything like this.
They rode off in that carriage to the the palace.
So everybody was watching her dancing with him.
But she remembered the one thing her fairy godmother told her.
She hadta be home by the twelfth stroke of midnight.
So she looked at the clock and found oh no it was starting to chime midnight.
So she ran out as fast as she could.
The righthand man was following her out and trying to catch her.
She dropped one of her glass slippers that she had on.
He picked it up.
Well he went back to the king.
They the prince decided they hadta go find whoever that beautiful woman was.
So they went off.
They went to every house in the village.
When they got to cinderella's house cinderella had been locked in the back in her room.
She could not get out.
But the mice came in and opened up her door for her.
So then when the righthand man came with the shoe he was told to try it on every woman in the the village.
So he tried it on the two ugly stepsisters and did not fit.
So he said.
That is when the mice opened the door for cinderella.
She came out.
Yes i can try it on.
She tried on the glass slipper.
It fit like a glove.
So then they went off to the the palace.
She and the prince were married.
They lived happily ever after and rode off in a coach together.
Oh i do not like jelly on my peanut butter sandwich.
Know how to make ththem bebecause i make ththem for my wife.
First you get out some good bread.
It is always got to be fresh bread.
So you get that out.
Then you get out peanut butter.
Ya take the peanut butter.
Ya get smear peanut butter on one piece of bread.
Then you get the jelly out.
You take a knife.
You spread it on the other piece of bread.
Then you put ththem together.
Okay i am probably going to change stories because i think last week i told you about the birth of my granddaughter.
This time i am going to tell you about a vacation we took in twenty sixteen.
But there was a like death is what they called it.
Was basically in a prison that they would take the prisoners across that.
You would never see the prisoners again.
Padua was saint anthony who helps you find things.
I can remember some of this stuff.
But in padua we got to see where he was born and where he was buried.
Then we went from there to assisi which is saint francis of assisi which a lot of people have heard of saint francis.
But we got to go to the cathedral basilica where he he got a vision from god that said.
He thought it was talking about this little church that was in assisi.
So he went to the little church and rebuilt it.
"Then god said nah , gave him more of a clarification and got him going."
But we got to see where his little church was which is now inside of a big basilica.
We got to see where he was born.
We got to see his basilica which is huge.
Interesting thing was they had been having earthquakes there.
So there were lots of.
So lots of wall paintings that had big cracks in ththem.
They were starting to the repair work on it.
Then the last part of that in assisi we went to where francis was a monk and where his community was.
They had a real neat thing.
There was one guy from ireland that came and talked to us.
He could talk to us in english.
You know everybody else was italian.
So he talked to us in english.
So let us see.
From there we went to florence.
But towards the late afternoon it started raining.
It rained and it rained and it rained.
Dinner was supposed to be out on the the big plaza in florence.
I did not want to go to dinner there because it was just raining.
So we walked back to our hotel which was probably a mile and a half maybe two miles.
We got back to the hotel.
Changed into dry clothes bebecause we were soaked all the way through.
We were trying to figure out what we were going to do for dinner which ended up being mcdonald's.
There was a mcdonald's close by.
When everybody that was on the tour to the hotel they had all had dinner down at the square.
They came back and asked us what we did for dinner.
I says.
Oh we went to ronaldo's.
They had them baited.
They finally caught on it was ronald mcdonald's.
I got to see the pope.
I have a picture where the pope's twenty feet from me.
Jimmy was playing with his soccer ball out in front of the house.
He would kick the ball up in the air and kick it again.
Then one time he kicked it.
It went right through the picture window in the front of the house.
It knocked over a lamp and woke his dad up from a nap.
It woke him up from his nap.
"So daddy his dad went , looked out the window."
I have got your soccer ball.
No more soccer for you til this window's fixed.
Your allowance goes to fix the window.
His mother says.
Billy i want you to take this umbrella because it is going to be raining.
Billy says.
No i do not want the umbrella.
So she walks him to the door and says.
He says.
Nah i can get there with no problem.
So he starts walking to school.
Lo and behold down comes the rain.
Boy did it come down.
So he turned around and ran home.
By the time he got home he was soaking wet.
His mother was saying.
I told you you should have taken the umbrella.
But he took the umbrella after he got dry clothes on.
He made his way back to school with an umbrella and stayed dry for the trip.
Little susie had a cat.
Susie was riding on her tricycle.
She scared the cat.
The cat ran up the tree.
Well susie could not get the cat to jump down.
So she got her daddy and said.
Daddy please come get the cat out of the tree.
So daddy climbed up the tree and got on a branch.
He could not move.
Then he was shouting at susie.
Susie said.
Oh no what are we going to do?
So the dog started barking at daddy up in the tree.
So susie said.
I will go call the fire department.
So she called the fire department by dialing nineoneone.
The fire department came along.
They brought ladders.
They came.
They get daddy out of the tree.
Daddy got out of the tree.
There was just one bird that just sitting there whistling away laughing at the man and the cat stuck in the tree.
He was getting a new wife who would be cinderella's stepmother.
Her stepmother had two little girls that were about the same age as cinderella.
The stepmother had a cat.
Cinderella had a dog.
Cinderella thought everything could be good.
Her dad thought everything would be good.
Well as they grew up the stepsisters really were not nice to cinderella.
They did things like they made her do all the chores then throw things at her then make her clean the floors clean the cinders out of the fireplace then make her take care of all the animals including their cat.
Their cat did not like cinderella.
So that was always not fun because cinderella had friends that were mice.
So that was kind of tough thing to do.
So every night she would go to her room.
She would look out her rindow.
She could see in the distance.
She could see the palace.
She looked at the palace and says.
Oh i wish i could go there someday just to see what it is like.
So she just would go to bed at night and dream of it.
Well meanwhile at the palace the king and his righthand man would go through and try to figure out what what was needed because the king was getting old.
He would need to step down soon.
Well he had a son who was a prince.
But the prince did not have a wife.
He wanted the prince to have a wife before he would give him the kingdom.
So they decided they would have a grand ball and invite the eligible young women from around the the village.
They sent out invitations to everybody.
The stepmother got the invitation and was reading it.
Cinderella read it over her shoulder.
Cinderella thought.
I get to go.
Her stepmother did not say anything.
You cannot go.
So she went to her room.
She got out a book that had pictures of ballgowns that she could have.
She talked to her friends the mice.
They took a dress that she had.
They put bows and frills on it and things like that and made it a pretty dress for her.
So she thought.
Well i have got what i need.
I can go now.
They cannot say i do not have a ballgown.
So she went downstairs where her mother and stepsisters were getting ready to leave.
When they saw her dress they were upset.
One of the stepsisters ripped her dress.
One of them ripped her necklace off of her.
Of course the stepmother did not do anything about it.
She did not know what to do.
So she ran out to the garden.
When she was at the garden she was crying.
Her fairy godmother ask her what was wrong.
She explained.
The fairy godmother says.
Well we can take care of that.
So the fairy godmother waved her magic wand.
The mice and a pumpkin that were sitting there turned into a coach the footmen the driver and the horses.
But cinderella still did not have a dress.
So the fairy godmother waved her magic wand.
Cinderella got a beautiful dress just magically appeared on her.
Her hair was all done up nice.
Her fairy godmother told her only one thing you need to do.
You need to be home before the stroke of midnight because after the stroke of midnight the the.
I am looking for my word.
The the carriage that she went in after midnight would go.
Everything would change back to what it was.
So she went to the ball.
The prince saw her.
He was just taken with her.
He went and asked her to dance.
They danced many dances.
Her stepsisters and her stepmother did not recognize that it was her.
So she danced and she danced.
Then she started to hear the stroke of midnight.
Oh no i have got to get out of here.
So she turned.
She ran.
She was running down the stairs.
One of her shoes fell off.
But the righthand man was following her.
He picked up the glass slipper.
Cinderella got in the coach and went away and all changed back to mice and pumpkins.
So she got home.
It happened that she was there.
She was so happy that she had had the chance.
Well she was showing the mice her one glass slipper that she still had.
The prince went to the righthand man and the king and said.
I want to find this girl.
So the righthand man and another guy went to all the houses in the village looking for the person that could wear that glass slipper that they found.
They tried it on all the women.
They got to cinderella's house.
The stepsisters tried the shoe on.
They could not get it on.
The the stepmother had locked cinderella in her room because she had gone out without knowledge.
So the mice helped her get out of the room by unlocking the door for her.
She came downstairs.
The righthand man says.
Let us try this shoe on you.
They all laughed.
Well she sat down.
They put the shoe on her.
It fit perfectly.
So it was like a glove how it went on.
Cinderella then produced the other glass slipper out of her pocket.
Oh my gosh what is going on here?
Well that did not matter because now cinderella was known.
So they took her to the palace for the prince.
The prince and cinderella got married and lived happily ever after.
Remember last week i do not eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
First thing i would do is get a plate and a knife.
Then i would go get some peanut butter and two slices of bread and a jar of jelly.
The first thing i would do is i would take peanut butter.
I would spread it on one of the pieces of bread just on one side of one piece of bread.
Then i would get the jelly.
I would spread it on one side of the other piece of bread.
When i had them both completed i would put them together.
But then you have to cut it in quarters because that makes it so you can handle it to eat it easier without getting messy.
I have been thinking about this lately.
Okay i am going back to my childhood.
I grew up riding horses.
I had to have a horse.
I knew from early on that i wanted a horse.
So i finally got a horse.
My mom found me a trainer someone to teach me how to ride and show horses.
It came to.
I was i think eight years old.
I came to my first horse show.
I got on sam was the name of the horse and was very nervous had on my full tuxedo thing.
"So in in horses when you show you walk , trot and canter."
When you wanted to make sam canter you tapped his left shoulder with your boot.
The announcer said.
This horse in front of me kicked sam in the left shoulder.
Sam took off in a gallop.
I could not stop the horse.
He was taking pictures of me falling off sam.
I fell flat on my back.
I lost my breath.
I could not breathe.
My father who was a doctor he jumped the fence.
He immediately resuscitated me back to the breathing.
The the highlight of the story is my parents never went and watched me show horses again.
They it stressed them out too much.
But that was the only bad horse show i had.
I went on to show horses very very happily.
The love of my life was showing horses for the next five years i guess.
The young boy's playing practicing soccer in his yard and kicks the ball through a window hopefully of his own home and hits his dad on the lap.
The ball goes right in the lap.
The father looks out the window.
Who hit me?
Who broke my window with the soccer ball?
It is going to rain.
I do not want the umbrella.
Oops it is starting to rain.
I should have taken that umbrella.
Now i am getting really wet.
I think i will go home and get the umbrella.
See i told you it was going to rain.
Then he goes to school with the umbrella.
Okay a little girl is riding her tricycle around.
She saw a cat in the tree and wanted to help the cat get down even though it looks perfectly happy.
So she could not climb up the tree herself.
So she asked her dad.
Dad came with a ladder to save the cat.
But he subsequently got stuck in the tree.
The ladder fell.
But the little girl does not care about her dad being stuck.
The dog is really excited because so much is happening.
So he is barking.
But somehow the fireman came.
Maybe the dad called before knowing that he would not be able to help much.
So he called the firemen.
They have arrived to save both of them.
So well i know the gist of it but not every detail.
So cinderella has two stepsisters.
But the stepsisters get favored all the time by the stepmother.
"Cinderella in effect has to serve them , wait on them clean the house do all the heavy lifting while the two sisters do not have to do anything."
Then they get invited to a ball a dancing ball.
It looks like cinderella had a dress to wear and was planning on going to the ball.
But looks like they took the ribbon off of her dress.
Which i do not remember.
I thought she did not have anything that she was not expected to go.
But from the book it looked like they she found something to wear.
"So the stepsisters went without her , thinking cinderella was not going to go."
Then a fairy godmother came and helped cinderella with a beautiful dress and a fantastic carriage that she turned into from a pumpkin and mice that turned into horses.
She goes in this grand style to the ball.
Of course the prince likes her the best and dances with her the most.
Then she is got to leave suddenly at midnight because her fairy godmother said.
You can have all this.
Then be home by then or because everything is going to go away.
The horses turn back into mice.
The carriage turns into a pumpkin.
You are going to have your regular clothes on.
So she leaves at midnight.
The prince is heartbroken.
In the course of her running away to make it by midnight she drops one of her glass slippers.
The prince gets it.
So then the prince has his men search high and low for every women who can try this glass slipper on.
That is how he finds her.
So it only fits her foot.
So she tries it on.
Then the prince has identified her.
They get married.
They live happily ever after.
Okay first you go into the kitchen.
You find the bread.
You untwist the little twisty of the bread.
You pull out two two pieces of bread.
I am assuming you are making one sandwich.
Then you find the peanut butter.
You untwist the lid.
If i have not said get a knife get a knife out of the drawer.
Then you need the jelly.
So you go to the refrigerator open the door rifle through the shelves bebecause you do not know where it is.
Then you find the jelly that you like.
You open the lid.
So you stick it under the hot water.
It unsticks.
So you put your knife in the jelly.
You spread jelly on the peanut butter.
Then you top the sandwich off with the other piece of bread.
You get a plate.
You put it on the plate.
You cut it in half if you like ththem cut to eat ththem that way.
I am done.
Okay so i think it was the.
So i was in the fourth grade i think.
A boy in my class his name was firstnamel lastnamef sat in front of me.
One day he turned around and said to me.
I would never heard that word before.
I but he said it with you know some kind of anger.
So i you know just sat there and took it.
Went home and i got in a fight with my my older brother who was always picking on me.
He he kind of terrorized me actually.
But we were having some kind of fight window.
Either he was trying to open it or i was trying to keep it closed or vice versa.
I do not remember.
But he was going to overpower me.
I could sense that.
So i repeated the same words to him.
He said.
Oh you are going to get in so much trouble.
He screamed.
Mom mary just said the dirtiest word in the whole world.
Oh and then you know i became like his picking point for walking home.
He would throw things at me.
He was on my walk home back when kids useta walk to school.
Little a young child is playing practicing soccer in a yard.
He hits a ball through the window.
The ball crashes through the window and onto an unassuming man's lap.
He is sitting there on the couch.
This ball comes crashing through the window and lands on his lap.
The man stands up to see where the ball came from.
Okay so mother wants her little boy to go off to school with the umbrella because she has heard it is going to rain.
He says.
I do not need an umbrella.
So he takes off.
Lo and behold ah it is raining.
He turns around and does not like getting wet.
He says.
I guess i needed that umbrella.
So now he is going off to school with the umbrella hopefully in dry clothes.
Okay so the little girl was sitting on the porch board.
She heard a bird sing and wanted to see the bird that was singing.
She did not see it.
So she walked toward the tree toward the sound of the bird singing.
While she was there she saw the cat.
Even though the cat is just sleeping she wanted to bring the cat down from the tree.
So actually the dog chased the cat up the tree.
So while the bird was singing and the girl was sitting on the porch the dog had found the cat and chased the cat up the tree.
But she still followed.
She did not see any of that.
She just wanted to see the bird and then saw the the cat and asked her.
Oh she rode her tricycle over to see the cat.
So she tried to rescue the cat but could not.
She tried to stand up on her tricycle and did not did not work could not reach it.
So she went and got her dad and the ladder.
Well he got the ladder.
She would not think about that.
He went and climbed up the tree with the ladder.
Then the ladder fell.
The little girl's too young to pick up the ladder.
So he is stuck.
I guess the mom called the fire department.
The fire department is coming to save the day.
Once upon a time there was a young girl named cinderella her mother died.
The father remarried a a woman with two children two girls.
These girls became her stepsisters as a result.
They cinderella was this really sweet girl and ended up kind of being her their her servant to the sisters who did not include her and did not play with her and were kind of mean to her and basically ostracized her.
So she kind of kept to herself.
From their view of their home they could see the palace.
Cinderella would dream about what was happening in the palace.
That day they got an invitation to a ball from at the palace.
All the girls got very excited.
Cinderella prepared something very pretty to wear to to the ball and came down that night to go to the ball.
The stepsisters said.
You are not going to the ball with us.
So the stepsisters went and to the ball.
A fairy godmother appeared in before cinderella.
Maybe she gave her three wishes.
I do not know.
But the fairy godmother enabled her to go to the ball.
She turned her her ordinary dress into a beautiful formal gown and turned a pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses and told her that she could enjoy all of this until midnight when everything will go back to reality her reality.
So she said okay.
So she went to the ball and had a wonderful time.
The prince fell in love with her.
When midnight was about to strike and she told the prince she had to leave.
She did not give him an explanation.
"So she left , went running back bebecause he she did not want him to see her in her ordinaryness ordinaryness."
So so she gets in her carriage.
Everything turns into a pumpkin.
The horse horses turn back into mice.
The prince misses her.
So he sends out a decree to.
Oh he finds her slipper.
So when she is running back she loses her slipper.
So he he finds the slipper and decides to send the slipper around to see what girl's foot fits the slipper.
So they send this person around.
The stepsisters their their feet do not fit the slipper.
So they find her.
They get married and happily ever after.
That is all i remember.
You can cut it cut.
But it has two parts.
I guess every new mother is nervous.
I i was not nervous to have a baby except that she came so fast.
She came on her due date which is precisely who she is.
I got to the hospital and had was already you know at like eight or something.
So there were very few options for me except to just have the baby.
I did.
I just remember her coming out and looking like this little monchichi which is a toy from when i was younger.
She had this brown hair all over.
I have light hair.
Her dad has light hair.
Anyways it is just that kind of thing that it does not go away.
I remember what i was wearing when i got there.
I i remember where i was sitting in the car.
I remember the stop lights we went through.
I remember the path to the hospital.
I remember everything about it.
So it is like you i remember every detail.
Then my whole world just you know she was always there then.
Then her brother i was nervous to have because it was so traumatic for me to have firstnameg because she like i said came so fast.
When i got to the hospital there was nothing to do except have this baby.
So when i was pregnant with firstnamel i just remember my gynecologist like.
You know you had a very quick first born.
This is going to happen again.
I sat.
I was dilated at maybe three or four for weeks.
All i could think was.
When is that terrible horrible pain going to come back?
That is not how it worked at all actually.
I i he was also born on his due date.
So now we have determined it is me who hasta have things in the right place.
But we rode to the hospital.
I checked myself in.
He came out with this white hair this golden kind of face.
I just remember thinking you know there are so many times when people say you know no two kids are alike.
Or boy girl two boys two girls does not matter.
But they are the best things i have.
I look at my life.
So that is i guess important story in two parts.
So jack was out in his front yard practicing for a soccer game that was coming up.
He was really enjoying himself.
He loves soccer so much.
He loves to kick the ball.
His his mom has always said.
Be careful because you you know that that ball can be destructive you do not control it proper properly.
So he kicks the ball.
It goes into the window where his dad is currently sitting and watching tv it looks like.
It knocks down a lamp.
It breaks the window.
His dad looks out the window at him.
Holding and he holds the ball and looks at jack and says to himself.
This has happened to me before.
I am not going to yell at my kid.
Okay so leo was getting ready to walk to school.
His mom said.
Hey you you really should take this umbrella because it is going to start raining.
You are going to be really uncomfortable when you are walking to school with no umbrella.
You get all wet.
He does not really want to take it.
So he says.
I i got this.
I will beat the rain.
So he says goodbye.
She looks a little you know disconcerted bebecause this is not going to work out.
Now he is walking to school and is starting to get really wet.
The rain's coming down harder and faster.
He is not going to get to school.
He is barely even made it a a quarter of the way to school.
So he is going to rush back to the house as wet as he is and hafta look his mom in the eye and say.
I probably should have taken the umbrella.
I am sorry i did not.
But i really need to take it now.
So he takes the umbrella and finish his walk to school.
He is much more comfortable without all of the rain falling on him.
So it looks like a pretty nice day.
It was a day that this little girl was playing outside.
She was clearly playing with her dog and riding her bike.
The cat got out.
The cat ended up in the tree.
So she hadta ask her dad to come help her get the cat out of the tree.
She decided to call the fire station so that the firefighters could come out and help dad and the cat get out of the tree.
The firefighters are rushing in in all their gear which is interesting because it is not an actual fire.
But it is hot and heavy to help this this dad and this cat get out of the tree.
But that is what they are going to do.
So they are approaching dad.
They are going to put the ladder up and maneuver dad out of the tree first.
Then they are going to get the cat out of the tree after that.
Then the girl is going to take the cat inside and come back out and finish riding her bike and playing with her dog.
So i guess it was a long time ago that there was a woman.
She had two daughters.
A man who had a daughter.
Cinderella ended up in this home with two stepsisters.
They were unpleasant to her because she always seemed to make everything look happy and bright.
Even animals cheered up when they were around her because she just let off this gift of light and love.
So they mistreated cinderella and had her do terrible things that none of them wanted to do.
So cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and wonder about what life was like outside of the walls she lived in.
The castle there was a family obviously who lived there.
The prince was looking to find love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all everyone in the entire village come to this ball.
So cinderella's stepsisters got all of their you know their lovely items together and their dresses and their hair and all of these things.
Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball.
Since her stepmother and her stepsisters did not help her all of the animals did.
So the the animals who loved cinderella because she was so good put together a beautiful gown for her.
Just as cinderella thought she was going to get out of the house her stepsisters and her stepmother ruined her gown.
The stepsisters went off to the ball.
Cinderella was left with you know ripped up dress and and nothing to do.
So this fairy godmother showed up and said.
You have so much love to give.
I really want you to go to the ball.
So i am going to create a horse and carriage and a new outfit for you.
It is going to be so lovely.
But it ends at midnight.
So you have to make sure you come home before then.
So cinderella goes to the ball.
Her stepsisters were not pleased because everyone stared at cinderella when she came in because was just so beautiful.
The prince of course noticed her beauty and grace and again this kind of calm light soothing to people that she let off.
He danced with her.
Just then she realized it was almost midnight.
So she ran out.
She lost one of her shoes.
She did not even make it home when everything went back to the way that it was.
Then one of the people who worked at the castle came around with the slipper that was found at the ball and tried it on every woman in town.
It fit cinderella.
The prince found her by her dainty little glass shoe.
They lived happily ever after.
So i keep my bread in the fridge.
So i would go to the fridge.
I would grab the bread and the jelly.
I would go to my pantry to get the peanut butter.
I would go to the drawer to get the knife.
I probably would then wash my hands.
I would do this on a cutting board.
I would take two pieces of bread out.
I would put them next to one another.
I would take my knife and spread peanut butter on one side.
Then the side that did not have anything on it yet i would use to wipe the excess peanut butter off of my knife.
Then i would go for the jelly.
I would put it on that side.
Then i would put the pieces together.
I would cut it diagonally.
That is i guess all i would do.
It was i would say just about.
There were some sundays we missed.
But we would go to my grandparents every sunday.
My grandparents my mom's parents were just everything that i wanted and thought was good about a marriage and a couple.
But my grandma had her own mind.
It is like he at that time was able to to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play.
But he did it.
So it was really important for me because i just had my mom at home to see this really healthy dynamic between two people.
I would get there.
My grandpa he always had a handful of nuts because there was a squirrel named petey who lived in the tree in front of his house.
There were probably twenty peteys.
But i thought it was petey.
I just always called him petey.
So we would feed petey.
Then we would go inside.
My grandma would always have cooked some kind of dinner late afternoonish dinner.
You know everything was always homemade and wonderful.
She laid out the table so beautifully.
She would always have the most amazing desserts.
So we would do that.
We would have our nice lunch.
We would all clean up.
Then my grandpa would pull carrots out of the refrigerator.
We would walk to this little horse stable area right near their house.
But on the way he would always turn it into just a really neat adventure.
He would would talk about the different creatures that were in the forest.
He would turn it into this super enchanted thing.
We would always end up then at the horses stable.
We would feed the horses and walk back home.
But it was amazing because we literally did this every sunday or like i said almost every sunday.
You know the same petey the same beautifully spread dinner the same enchanted walk to the forest the same horses.
So i would say that is definitely one of the most important memories days events for me.
So there was a super cool kid who was really good at soccer.
He knew he was so good that he could just kick the ball anywhere that he wanted to anytime.
That is what he was doing until he accidentally kicked the ball into his neighbor's house and broke the window.
It knocked down his lamp and disrupted his television watching for the afternoon.
Then he looked out the window to see where the ball came.
His teacher was suggesting that because he is a walker she she said.
You know you you really need to take my umbrella because it is going to start raining.
I do not want you to get wet on your walk home.
The little boy said.
I am going to be fine.
You keep your umbrella because i do not want you to get wet when you walk out to your car.
So she kept her umbrella.
Then the little boy started walking.
The rain started coming down harder and harder.
He thought.
So i need to go back to school.
I am going to have to let my teacher know that she was right.
I need that umbrella so that i do not ruin the school's tablet.
So he went back.
That is what he did.
He told her that he was wrong and that she should let him hopefully take the umbrella and use it to walk home.
She did.
So he walked home happily with his umbrella protecting his tablet from the rain.
Okay so there is a girl who was playing outside in her yard one day.
She was riding her tricycle and playing with her dog and with her cat.
This man came from across the street a neighbor.
Her dog started chasing the man.
The man got really scared and got a ladder and climbed up in the tree and sat there.
Then his ladder fell down.
Then the girl's cat followed the man up there.
So from the inside her babysitter called the fire station to get the firefighters to come help get the man and the cat out of the tree.
So once upon a time there was a really really nice man who sadly lost his wife and had a daughter named cinderella.
He was pining over this woman who had two children of her own.
She also had lost her spouse.
They decided they were going to get married and join their family together.
All of the animals loved her.
Her father loved her.
Everything she did was just sweet and kind and good.
So they made her do all of the worst things.
They made her do all of the cooking and all of the cleaning.
She did not get to wear any nice clothes.
But she was lucky because she had all of the animals as her friends.
They encouraged her and were kind to her.
They noticed that she would look out at the castle and wonder what life would be like in the castle outside of the place she lived.
One day then the king of that castle wanted his son to meet women in hopes that he would become married.
He sent a notice across the village.
So her stepsisters were starting to get all of their things together what they were going to wear and what they were going to do.
Cinderella did the same.
She found a book to help her make something.
The animals helped her make something.
Then her stepsisters were again so jealous and envious of how beautiful she was that they ruined her dress.
Her fairy godmother appeared and turned everything into the most beautiful things ever.
She had a lovely carriage and horses to drive the carriage.
She went to the ball.
When she got there the prince wanted to dance with her because like everyone else he noticed that she was the kindest gentlest most beautiful creature in the room.
So they danced and danced.
Cinderella noticed it was almost midnight.
Her fairy godmother had told her that at the stroke of midnight everything would turn back to normal and that she needed to be out of the castle by then.
So she ran out.
But on the way she lost a shoe.
She went home and was very very sad.
They locked her in a room so she could not get out.
But the mice noticed that the prince's page was bringing around a shoe to to fit to all the women.
They snuck the keys under the door.
Cinderella got out.
The shoe fit her.
She and the prince lived happily ever after.
Okay if i were to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would first get out all of my supplies.
I would get out a cutting board.
I would put my two slices of bread on the cutting board.
I would get probably a napkin the peanut butter the jelly and a knife.
I would open up so that you know the two slices are on the cutting board.
I would first apply the peanut butter with the knife.
Then i would wipe the residual peanut butter that is on the knife on the clean piece of bread.
Then i would get the jelly.
I would put it on what was the clean slice with the residual peanut butter.
I would put my jelly there.
Then i would take the napkin to wipe off the jelly.
Or if i did not do that i would put it under the water in the sink just because the jelly gets sticky.
When it hardens it is hard to get it off when you wash it.
But anyway then i would put my slices together.
I would cut my sandwich diagonally.
She did not tell any of us.
But she started losing weight and sleeping a lot.
She finally went in and got diagnosed with bowel cancer.
It was very confusing and scary for all of us because noone in my family had experience with terminal cancer.
The doctor did not give clear communication about what we should expect.
So initially we thought her cancer could be cured with surgery.
Later it was revealed that you know this was stage four cancer.
There was no way it was going to get better.
She very much wanted to stay at home.
I was not living in in my hometown anymore.
So it was my mom that was really taking care of her.
She could no longer take care of my grandmother.
She was having a lot of issues.
So we brought her back to the hospital.
She kept saying how much she wanted to go home.
Mom and my brother who was in medical school at the time said it just was not possible.
We could not care for her.
I was secretly hoping maybe we could take her home because for me there is something very sacred about being able to to be in your space.
So that did not happen.
She remained in the hospital and got progressively worse.
It happened over a period of weeks.
I remember visiting her in a hospital.
There was light coming in the window and windows.
Then she was transferred to another spot.
She was having trouble breathing.
So she had what is called a death rattle.
That is when whenever you breathe there is a rattle in your lungs.
I remember feeling very lost because it was the first time i i really been faced with the loss of a loved one.
She was kind of kept very lowkey with morphine.
But i remember hearing that that the hearing is the last sense that people lose.
So i would stay with her overnight.
I would hold her hand hoping that that would be soothing.
It occurred to me that i could could share with her memories of our time together and that i could recount beautiful images of our time at the lake shore where we have a family home.
You know hour by hour her condition was was just deteriorating.
It was painful to see how hard it was for her to breathe.
I i could not imagine what was sustaining her and why she was continuing in this harrowing state when there was absolutely no hope.
So finally i actually held her hands.
I looked in her eyes.
Her whole family was gathered around.
I said.
If you are afraid to leave because of us trust that we we can make it.
We love you.
We send our love with you.
Our love will never be lost.
It is okay for you to leave.
In that very instant she took her last breath.
So my neighbor ernest was practicing soccer in the yard.
He kicked the ball through the window of his house.
It went right through to a lamp next to the armchair where his dad was sitting.
One day as he was getting ready to leave the house she offered him an umbrella because the weather forecast said it was going to rain.
But he declined.
He started walking to camp.
It started pouring rain.
He got drenched and turned around and ran home.
Judy was upset when he opened the door because he was all wet.
They changed clothes.
Then he willingly took the umbrella.
Now he is staying dry.
So the dog chased my cat up a tree on a beautiful spring day when the robins were building nests.
My dad got a ladder and climbed the tree in hopes that he could get the kitty down.
Unfortunately the kitty climbed out onto a far limb of the tree where he could not reach her.
Then his ladder fell down.
Our neighbor called the fire department.
They are approaching now with their ladder in hopes of rescuing my dad and the cat.
But the woman and her daughters whom she served were ugly.
Cinderella did things like serving tea.
The women whom she served were not very appreciative.
She would sit by her window.
From her room she had a direct view to the castle in the distance.
She often dreamed of a better life.
She had a mystical way with animals.
Although she was lonely she had friends who were the animals in the barn and also some mice and some birds blue birds specifically.
One day a proclamation came.
The prince was having a ball.
The woman and her two daughters were invited.
Cinderella got very excited and dreamed of the possibility of going.
Nor did she have the right clothes.
So these magical mice got together.
They showed cinderella a special magic chest where wishes come true.
She wished for a gown.
A gown was made and a necklace so that actually she could go to the ball.
But one of these young women ripped the necklace from her.
She felt that she could not attend.
The mice intervened again and brought her a wise old fairy godmother.
The godmother said.
I will make you a beautiful gown and slippers and a pumpkin coach so that you can attend the ball.
But there is only one stipulation.
That the the spell will only last until the stroke of midnight.
So you you must be back before the stroke of midnight or the illusion will be broken.
So she went to the ball.
She danced with the prince.
They had a wonderful time.
But she looked up and noticed it was almost midnight.
So she quickly ran away.
But in the process of exiting she left her her glass slipper behind.
But she managed to make it home with one slipper just as the pumpkin coach was turning back into a pumpkin.
So she resumed her work as a maid.
Awhile later a messenger from the prince came.
He was making calls to the different homes in the kingdom trying to find someone who fit the glass slipper.
When he knocked on the door of the older woman and her daughters were very excited.
They hoped that they could could maybe be the match.
But alas their their feet did not work.
But the slipper fit cinderella perfectly.
So her her destiny was revealed.
She reunited with the prince.
She was introduced at home.
She lived with her dog and the prince.
If the shoe fits wear it.
I have no jelly at home.
So i would have to go to the store and buy some.
I would get raspberry that is flavored with pectin rather than sugar.
I would come home.
I would use really good multigrain bread which i keep in the fridge.
It is sprouted.
I would remove the loaf of bread from the fridge along with the jar of peanut butter.
I would place it on the counter.
I would take down a plate.
I would put two slices of bread on the plate.
I would take a knife from the silverware drawer.
I would actually take two knives.
I would spread peanut butter on one of the open slices.
Then with the other knife i would spread the very good raspberry jam.
Then i would put the two slices together so that the peanut butter and the jelly were touching.
Then i would cut that sandwich diagonally down the middle.
I purchased my house.
I live towards the end of a dead end.
I was so excited because i thought given the road i live on it will be safe to let my animals go outside.
I came home.
I found my kitty had been hit by a car and was dead in front of my home.
It was devastating because i came to this place with this vision of safety for my animals.
I went through grief.
Then i did some prayers.
Time passed.
It was coming up on summer solstice.
I started imagining.
Bebecause the kitty i lost was a girl.
I thought.
Gosh my household really needs a female kitty.
If if if a cat would just happen to cross my path i would consider adopting a female.
If that cat just happened to be a tortoiseshell that would be even better.
So i went to a party hosted by a friend of mine who lived in the country.
She was taking care of a litter of kittens who had been born on her land.
There was one left.
So i took that as a sign that she was meant to be mine.
The janitor at school was taking a break in the lounge which happens to be near the soccer field.
Some kids were playing on the field outside practicing.
One of them kicked a ball.
It went through the window into the lounge and knocked over a lamp next to where the janitor was sitting.
But he did get up and look out the window to see what had happened.
So so justin's mom wanted him to carry an umbrella to school.
He said no and waved goodbye.
But on the way it started to rain.
He got soaked while running home.
He arrived back.
But after changing and drying off second time around he agreed to take his umbrella.
Now he is staying dry as he walks to school late.
So my neighbor has an apple orchard.
He was harvesting apples this last fall.
In the process his ladder fell down.
He got stuck.
So he called out for help.
His cat came.
She climbed up a tree but was unable to help.
Then the dog came.
But he could not climb the tree.
So he just had to stand at the base barking.
Even a little bluebird came.
But she also could not help.
His daughter came running and jumped off her tricycle.
But she cannot reach anyone.
But thankfully she told her mom who was also there.
The mom actually ran indoors and called the fire department.
So the firemen had just arrived.
So so cinderella lived in a home with her uncle and a little dog.
There was an opportunity for her uncle to send cinderella to live with a relative and her daughters which were cinderella's cousins.
The hope was that they would all become friends and that cinderella would enjoy having people like sisters around her.
But what happened instead was that she was put in a position of of servitude with her aunts and cousins.
She actually became kind of an indentured servant.
So she would serve them and clean.
She did not even live in the house.
She lived with the barn animals who became her friends.
She would daydream in the barn about visiting a castle in the kingdom that was far away.
But she could see the valley in the distance.
But she imagined it would be a long long distance to ever be able to visit the castle.
But one day an invitation came from the prince that he was having a ball.
He invited cinderella's aunt and sisters.
She assumed that she could go.
Her barnyard friends revealed the secret chest to her which she opened to a book of magic.
She arrived to accompany her her kin.
They absolutely rejected the possibility of her going.
They ripped the necklace off her neck.
She granted cinderella's wish of attending the ball.
But to do so she would have to go in costume and kind of disguise her appearance.
So cinderella was dressed in magical finery with glass slippers and new hair and makeup.
As a final touch her fairy godmother created a pumpkin coach and a fleet of horses to take her to this special ball.
When she actually was there and had fulfilled her dream of actually being in the castle she was invited to dance with the prince himself.
The prince was so taken by her that he longed to spend more time.
She fled so quickly that she lost one of her glass slippers en route.
She fled back to her carriage and was taken home to the barnyard.
The reason she departed in such a hurry was that one of the stipulations the fairy godmother had given was that she would need to be home by midnight or else the the spell would wear off and her true identity would be revealed.
So for days afterwards cinderella was reveling in the joy of this experience but also saddened by her lot in life and the fact that it was such a short lived pleasure.
But one day a knock came on the door.
It was a court magistrate from the prince who had this slipper and was going around the households trying to find this special lost woman.
He knew if the shoe fit he would identify this mysterious guest.
The shoe fit for cinderella.
So with that she was whisked away and rescued from the arms of her diabolical relatives and brought to the prince.
They married and lived happily ever after.
So you will need to go to the fridge and take out your loaf of bread.
You will take two slices and put them on a plate face up.
You will remove your peanut butter from the fridge and also your jelly.
You will extract a couple of knives from your silverware drawer.
You will use one knife to spread the peanut butter on one of these face up slices of bread.
You will have to open the jar first.
But once you have opened the jar you will have to stick the knife in and spread the peanut butter on.
Enough to cover the bread kind of with a bit of abundance so none of the bread shows through.
Then you will take the other knife.
You will open the other can which is of the jam.
You will put the knife in and spread the other slice of bread with this jelly also liberally so that you cannot see the bread.
Then you will put the two slices of bread together so the jam and the jelly meet and intermingle.
Then you will cut the sandwich down the middle.
It will be ready to eat if you so choose.
Well let us see.
When i was pregnant with my first child and i read this book by jenny mccarthy about when she was pregnant with her child.
She ate all these brownies.
I thought.
She looks great.
I am going to eat lots of brownies too.
That was a big mistake because i gained a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time.
And then my blood pressure went really high.
Towards the end of my pregnancy i ended up with toxemia.
So i they realized it when i had woken up one morning with it was probably beyond a migraine because i was very sensitive to everything.
My husband was blowing his nose in the other room.
I wanted to kill him.
And my it was like a pulsating thing in my head.
I went in clinic which was close to my house.
I lived in japan at the time.
So i went in.
It was by this point in my pregnancy i was going to the clinic quite often.
You would have to come in pee in a cup go get your blood pressure taken.
Then you would have about two minutes to talk to the doctor and and talk really fast and write everything down that he says.
Then you would have to wait an hour to get in there.
Well that day i came in went to pee in a cup and then went to go to take my blood pressure.
I would have to sit at this machine.
It takes your blood pressure and prints it out.
So i did.
I went put it in there printed it out.
I handed it to the nurse.
You have to go back and do it again.
So i do it again.
It prints it out.
Why do not you know how to do this?
Then they take me in.
Then the nurse who is the professional right does it and realizes.
Holy crap this woman's got really high blood pressure.
Then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor i got swept in right away.
They said.
We are checking you in right now because this is very serious.
They checked.
They had like sugar or something in my urine and my yeah.
So there is all kinds of problems happening with me unbeknownst to me.
So then they send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet.
After a couple of days my blood pressure went down.
But then they said.
Well it is you are we could send you home.
But but we are not a hundred percent sure that you could control this.
So we think we should induce you because i was far enough along.
They said.
At five thirty in the morning we are going to bring you down to induce you.
But they made me take a suppository which is really whoo.
But the fun part was was that it was in a room where there were other people.
So they could all hear what was happening in there.
But i come out.
They give me this shot.
I could feel contractions coming on.
Everybody's i could hear them outside saying.
What is going on in there?
You know it is like i have some kind of problem bebecause i am a foreigner.
So then it seems to be working.
It seems like.
Okay i am i am on the way going to have this baby.
Then it just kind of stopped.
They said.
Okay well it is not going to work today.
We will try again tomorrow.
So we go through the same thing again.
No actually i think i started on a monday.
So i was induced three days in a row.
And it seemed to work less every single time the the medicine or whatever it was.
I tried to tell them i am like.
But i think you are only giving me the amount of of medicine that you would for a small japanese woman.
So you need to give me more in order for this induce thing to work.
They said.
We are going to take the child out surgically.
So the story does not end.
So then they go and bring me in.
They had a gown on.
But then of course they take it off.
They had me lean naked on this woman who was a nurse.
I had to lean forward on her.
They went to put this shot in my back.
But then the doctor kept not getting it.
So they did three different shots.
Finally it worked.
So then they had me lay back in like this t fashion and put up a curtain.
Men are not allowed in the.
So the husband's not allowed in there in japan.
So so yeah i just remember i did not really feel any cut or anything like that.
But then i felt like a tug tug tug.
Then i heard the baby crying.
Then you know it was all good after that.
So it was kind of like a scary story but then also happy in the end because i got my son.
But unfortunately he kicked the ball towards the house and towards the window.
It went right through the window and hits the man sitting down knocked over his lamp hit him in the knee.
He does not look angry just quite confused and looks out the window to try to figure out where in the world did this ball come from.
So at the beginning he said.
I am going to school.
Well it is going to rain today son.
You better take the umbrella with you.
No really i do not need it.
So number three he goes out and it rains.
Number four he is panicking and running back home because he realized of course his mother was right.
She looks at him a little bit frustrated.
But then she gives him the umbrella anyway.
Then he goes back to school with the umbrella.
I did not always do that right but.
So at the beginning of the story a cat climbed up in the tree because that is what cats like to do and then realized that it was in a pickle and started meowing.
The little girl cried.
Then the daddy went up there to go to get the cat out of the tree.
Then he found himself also in a pickle.
So then they had to go and call the fire department.
Then of course the dog gets involved because he does not understand why the daddy's in the tree.
Looks like at some point somebody tried to get a ladder.
He got the ladder to get up there.
But then maybe the dog knocked down the ladder.
So then that is why the fire department had to come.
As in many of the stories the mothers seems to be missing and has died or something like that.
So so the father decides to remarry to a woman known in the story as the stepmother wicked stepmother who happens to have two daughters the stepsisters.
They move in.
After which point but it seems like the something happens with the father.
The cinderella does not really have anyone anymore.
She just has the the animals who are her friends because otherwise she is cleaning the house and taking care of the wicked stepmother and the wicked stepsisters.
They they they kind of are quite selfish and do whatever they want.
Then from there oh there is the castle far far away.
One day the the stepmother hears of this announcement.
She reads in the book about how it looks like the prince is looking for someone to marry.
They are going to have all of these young women come to the castle for a ball.
So cinderella gets her lovely outfit made by herself and the animals.
No no that one was made by herself.
Then she goes and gets ready to go.
But then they say.
Oh no you are not going to go.
They rip all of her clothes off.
Then she is crying and very upset and goes upstairs and is in her room.
Then maybe she goes out to a garden actually.
That is when she meets her fairy godmother.
It seems like she sings a song with bippidy boppidy boo.
Anyway so she she waves her wand.
Then does her dog become a horse or one of the carriage men.
Then there there the pumpkin becomes her carriage.
Then the rule was that after at midnight you must be out of there because the magic will wear off.
She also gives her this beautiful white dress and a crown and glass slippers.
Then she goes off to the palace.
Of course the prince immediately falls in love with her and wants to dance with her all night long.
The stepsisters and the stepmother do not even recognize her.
Or everyone is watching and saying.
We do not know who she is.
Then this clock starts to strike midnight.
They so she has to run out.
She leaves the prince alone.
She is running down the stairs very quickly loses one of her glass slippers and then goes charging away to get back to the house.
Then the magic wears off.
So then once she gets back home i think as the story goes from the picture book it seemed like then they were trying to find who this beautiful young woman was.
All they had was the glass slipper.
From the picture book it looked like there was a.
In the picture book there was a man with a glass slipper.
It looked like he fell with the pillow.
I kind of assuming from that storybook that maybe he broke it.
But then i think cinderella had the other glass slipper.
So she must have come out with that.
But i remember from the story growing up that the stepsisters tried to stick their big old feet in it.
They did not fit.
But i did not see that storybook.
But i just remember that.
Then of course they realize.
Oh it must be her because her foot fits in the slipper.
Then it all was solved.
She went off to live with the prince and lived happily ever after.
Well i would take the bread and put it into the toaster.
Then i would take out the peanut butter and a knife.
I would put the knife into the peanut butter.
Then as soon as is finished toasting then i would take the peanut butter and spread it on all of the surface of the toast on the top and spread it into every single little corner.
Then after that then i would take the other piece of toast.
I would spread peanut butter all over that on every single little corner.
Then i would take a separate knife.
I would put it into the jam.
Then i would put it a little bit onto the jam and spread it.
Then i would put the two together.
Then i would cut them diagonally into two triangles.
Okay well i think i told you the story of my first son being born last week.
With my second son i i had a little toddler running around.
So i did not have any of the health scares or anything.
Like the entire pregnancy i do not think i vomited at all like i did every day with firstnamem.
It was just being able to take care of my my little fellow the the one that is running around and blah blah blah all the time.
So i went into the hospital and to get a checkup.
They had said.
Okay well you had a caesarean section before.
Now you are going to have to schedule another surgery.
I said.
The physician who was the one that was only a block away from where i lived said.
You can go to tokyo.
I am thinking.
Fine i will have another caesarean.
So so we scheduled a the csection for a thursday because that is when they did it.
I went in.
It was like i knew the drill this time.
I knew i am going to have to get naked again.
Then they are going to cut me open.
I think that the second time that they were better with the needle trying to get that into my spine.
I remember once again they after after they.
I could not feel it.
But they would cut me open.
Of course we knew it was a boy.
Then they bring him out.
But then he is also got this what looked like a wig.
This guy he had like pyew a big full set of black hair.
Oh yeah yeah he looks more like my husband for sure.
And he kind of listened to me.
But then then let us see what happened next.
Yeah i that that gets a little foggy because they put something system that made me go so they could sew me back up.
Yes after that i remember waking up upstairs on the clinic bed in my own room thank goodness.
They had those balloon things on my legs because i was paralyzed.
So that was supposed to keep the blood flowing.
Fortunately would slept quite a bit they just came and took off the balloons off of my legs.
This was probably i do not know how many hours later.
It hurt like crazy.
But i was determined to go to find this child that just came out of my body.
So once i was able to get up and start walking i was walking to find where the nursery was at.
I am coming down.
So i am going down and saying.
So we are i am looking for my baby.
I this time because the last time tell firstnamem my older son easily because he was like the blonde kind of white kid re.
This time it was hard to find my son because he blended in with all of the other children.
But then they let me take him up to my room.
Interestingly enough a lot of the moms especially ones with children that they have already had and they have children at home they they want to keep the child in the nursery so that they can get some rest.
No i want him up here.
We got to bond.
And i remember keeping him in the room and singing to him all the time.
There is some crazy foreign lady.
They are singing nonstop.
So we we were bonding.
But interestingly enough when my husband came and he brought firstnamem who was this.
Now by this time he actually has hair.
Unique because people would say he is like a blonde hair japanese boy bebecause he looked very japanese in the face.
He had this really blonde hair.
He comes up.
So he comes into the hospital room where i am at.
He is not even looking me at me at all.
He refuses because i left him.
In his mind he i left him.
He was going to give me the cold shoulder which he did for quite some time after that.
But eventually he got used to the idea of having a baby brother.
So there is the whole story.
So there is a young fella out playing soccer out in the yard which is where it should be and not inside of the house.
But unfortunately his aim is not so great because he accidentally kicks it through the window of his neighbor's house.
The neighbor who was sitting there watching television of course is in for quite a shock because he did not expect a a ball to come crashing through the window and then hitting his lamp and breaking his window.
So he picks up the ball and looks out the window and says.
I am going to get that durn kid.
Okay oops my screen just changed on me sorry come back.
There we go okay.
Okay so the beginning of the story mom is saying.
It is going to rain today.
You need to take your umbrella.
I do not mind the rain.
Because really it is going to rain.
They said it on the forecast.
Oh no it is raining.
What am i going to do?
Oh no now it is really coming down.
It is coming down buckets oh my gosh.
Then he has to come back and face his mother who knew it was going to rain.
She is not looking at him as if he is she is she is got this i told you so look on her face.
She is got this really kind of frustrated look on her face.
Oh why did not you just listen to me?
So then he goes ahead and takes the umbrella and then heads off on his way.
Looks like he is still wearing the same clothes though.
I would imagine that he would have changed bebecause he was pretty wet.
But now he is going on in number six and and going about his day and thinking.
In the future maybe i should listen to my mother a little bit more carefully.
Ah so the beginning of the story is a cat was being chased by a dog.
He ran up into the tree.
The dog could not get him.
Then the father came along and said.
Oh no i have to do something about this.
The daughter saw it.
She was crying and wanted to get her cat down.
The dog just keeps barking.
So he goes to get a ladder and said.
I will take care of it.
Well the dog is barking furiously and very excitedly and then accidentally knocks down the ladder.
So then the mother who is inside of the house sees the whole scene and has to call the fire department because they have a much larger ladder in order to go get dad and the kitty down.
So there was a man that had a daughter.
Apparently his wife must have died.
He lived at home with his daughter.
One day he must have decided that he was going to remarry because he brought into his house another woman who did not have a husband who just came with her and her two daughters.
So the assumption is that they were going to come to live with them.
Perhaps must be that they are going to get married.
Then time passes.
After time passes then we see that cinderella is not living with them as a sibling but rather as a servant.
So as a servant she is seems to be in charge of taking care of her stepsisters who appear to be quite spoiled and have little fancy curls in their hair.
The oh we hafta get whatever they want.
Cinderella to be the one that had to go and take care of things for them.
Then oh yes and cinderella she interestingly she did not seem to have any friends.
She her friends were there was a dog and some mice and a rather grumpy looking cat that it seemed like she had to befriend.
Then eventually the assumption is is that the cat also became her friend because she was such a very sweet and kind person.
Well moving forward one day she is looking out of her window which seems to be up on a hill.
Across that hill she looks across the town.
There is this huge beautiful castle.
So she is looking out at the castle.
It seems to be like beautiful.
Then there is a letter that the stepmother gets.
She reads it.
The letter says that the king is going to have a ball in honor of his son the prince and that prince is going to find someone to marry him.
Now all of the young women of the town want to go and meet the prince.
Of course everyone gets dressed and gets in their best clothes.
Even cinderella got a nice dress that she was going to wear.
But the stepsisters saw that.
They ripped it apart most likely because they were jealous of her beauty.
But also they thought she was unfit and that she should not be allowed because she is just a servant girl to go and be in the presence of the prince and the king.
So they tore off her dress.
I believe the stepmother gave her a list of things to do and sent her away.
Well the little mice decided that.
They of course had needles and the ability to sew and speak.
So they decided that they were going to fix a dress for her.
I cannot remember if the mice fixed the dress for her first or what it was.
Maybe the mice fix the dress first because she was so busy working.
Now i remember.
She goes outside.
She is crying.
Then there is this nice older woman who who has a special wand and says.
Oh dear i am going to take care of it for you.
Then poof she waves her wand and then turns a pumpkin into a carriage and her mice and dog friends into footmen and and horses.
Then then the next problem was that she did not have anything to wear.
So then she waves her wand and miraculously she is got a cool hairdo.
She is wearing a beautiful white dress and glass slippers.
So off she goes to the ball.
She gets to the ball.
She looks so amazing that noone knew who she was.
So then the prince i cannot take his eyes off off of her.
Dances with her all night until the clock starts to strike twelve.
So then she remembers something that the older woman the fairy godmother had said.
You have to get home before the last strike of twelve at midnight.
So she runs out of the castle because she does not want anyone to know her true identity.
She goes running down the stairs.
She as she is fleeing the scene she loses one of her glass slippers.
She is already gone.
And on the way home the pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin.
The dog turned back into a dog and etcetera etcetera.
But she goes home.
She is got these happy memories of being in the prince's arms.
I think that that her family.
I do not think that they knew that she was the one.
I think they had no idea.
But for some reason she was locked inside of her room because i remember that the mice had used to let her out.
So i do not remember why but she was locked in her room.
So the prince desperately wanted to find this beautiful young woman that he danced with.
So they send out the one of their servants to go out and try to find this woman by having all of them try on this glass slipper.
Ironically that no women seem to have a foot that fits into these.
I do not understand why does she have such tiny feet.
I do not get it.
But yeah that does not seem to work.
Then somehow because of the mice opening the door she is had been locked upstairs in some sort of a tower.
I do not know what it was.
Then she is freed.
She comes down.
She tries on the glass slipper.
It is discovered that yes indeed she was the one that was dancing with the prince.
Then she gets sent off to go with the prince and live happily ever after.
What happens with the stepmother and the stepdaughters i do not know.
But perhaps karma decided that.
I do not know.
I think that is the end of the story.
So i would take two pieces of bread and put them in the toaster.
I would toast them so it is a nice hard crunchy toast texture.
Then i would take out my chunky peanut butters with the nuts all chopped up in there.
I would take it with a knife and take out a whole big blob of peanut butter and smooth it across both of the pieces of toast.
Then i would find some raspberry jam.
I would spread to some on one of the pieces of toast.
Then i would put them together in a nice little like that.
Then voila you have a delicious peanut butter sandwich.
Well firstnamet should we tell her the story of when we got our first daughter?
We would like to tell you our happy story.
Firstnamet and i got married.
I worked for two years.
Then we decided it might be time for us to start our family.
But two more years went by.
It did not happen.
After a minimal amount of medical intervention not much we decided to sign up with an adoption agency.
We had talked about this before we got married that we thought we would like to have a family.
So now we have this opportunity.
So we signed up with the adoption agency.
After we had completed all of the paperwork they said.
Now you can wait.
Five months into the procedure i got a call one day from our social worker who said.
Are you sitting down?
I said.
She said.
We have a baby for you.
We have a little girl.
Can you come and get her tomorrow?
Firstnamet and i had been in the process of setting up the nursery.
Now he worked until two of the clock in the morning to finish painting and finish finish the crib.
So we got to our ten of the clock appointment the next morning.
I still remember how beautiful the golden cottonwood leaves were on the trees.
We were invited to come into the agency.
We filled out some papers.
Then we were ushered into the little nursery.
There in the little white crib wearing a tiny little pink dress with little white flowers lay our baby.
"We signed more paperwork , picked her up , loved her and took her home."
Four years later we adopted another child.
She has black hair and brown eyes.
She was born in south korea.
Well in the beginning there is a boy playing with his soccer ball.
He gives it a good kick.
It goes through the window of must be a neighbor.
Bounces through and lands almost on the lap of the neighbor who was sitting inside.
The neighbor picks up the soccer ball.
He goes to the window.
He looks out.
We need a few more pictures.
I do not know what happens next.
But i imagine that he sees the boy out there.
He is shouting in to the man.
Sir i am so so sorry i have broken your window.
The man said.
These things happen.
We can work together to find a way to repair the window.
So they did.
Are they mixed up these pictures?
So are the pictures going to stay here while i tell the story?
Once upon a time there was a little boy who was on his way to school.
His mother said.
The weather report says it is going to rain.
Here you take this umbrella.
He said.
No i do not want to take the umbrella.
You might get wet.
No i am not going to.
So the little boy began walking to school.
It began to rain.
Then it began to rain harder and harder and harder.
He splashed through the puddles.
He ran back to his home.
He said.
She said.
I will dry you off.
So he did.
So he strayed stayed dry on his trip to school.
Once upon a time there was a little girl who had a cat.
The cat was chased by a dog.
The cat ran up the tree and way out onto the limb as the dog stood barking there.
Then she called her dad.
She said.
Daddy come and get my cat down.
So the next thing that happened was that the father tried to climb the tree.
He got partway up.
Then he got stuck.
He could not get down.
The cat would not come down.
Somebody must have seen this and called the fire department because finally they came with their ladders.
They probably shooed away the dog.
They put the ladder up against the tree.
They helped the father down.
Then i am going to say the cat jumped down at his own free will.
Once upon a time there was a widower who had a young daughter.
He decided to remarry.
The woman that he chose had two daughters herself.
They insisted that cinderella do their laundry and bring them tea whenever they wanted.
"One day cinderella was looking looking out the window palace palace far far away in the distance , the castle where the prince lived."
One day the family received a letter in the mail an invitation because the king had become very concerned that he had not found a suitable wife for his son.
So he decided to give a ball a big dance.
He would invite all the young women in the kingdom.
So he sent out his invitations.
One arrived at the home of the widower and the stepmother and the three daughters.
We will go to the ball.
Prince will choose one of us.
Cinderella was looking over their shoulder.
She was also reading the invitation.
She thought.
Why i could go to that too.
So we she went up to her room.
When she looked in her trunk she looked through all of her things.
She found a pink and white dress that she thought probably would work.
The two little mice were watching.
They were cheering her on.
So cinderella put on her lovely pink and and white gown.
She went downstairs and to show the stepmother and the two stepsisters.
When they saw her they were irate and angry.
They said.
You cannot go to the ball with us.
With that they began to rip off the ribbons and the other fancy attire.
So cinderella had to go back up to her room.
The stepmother and the stepsisters not only that they locked her in her room so that there was no possibility of her leaving to go with them when they went off to the ball.
Then cinderella sat in her room weeping.
There appeared the fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother said.
Why are you weeping cinderella?
It is because my evil stepsisters and my stepmother will not allow me to go to the ball.
I wanted so much to go.
They tore apart my dress.
Now i have nothing to wear.
Oh yes you do.
With that she waved her magic wand.
Stardust fell all over the room.
Suddenly cinderella was clothed in the most beautiful white gown.
Her hair was done up in a very fancy hairstyle with a hairband.
The little mice cheered and said how wonderful she looked.
Cinderella said.
But i have no way to get to the ball.
Well yes you do.
With that she waved her magic wand again.
Stardust fell room.
There the pumpkin had been turned into a beautiful carriage.
The little mice became her footmen.
Excuse me suddenly there were six horses.
All of them were attired in beautiful plumage.
They became the the horses that would draw the golden pumpkin carriage.
So the fairy godmother helped cinderella to climb up into the carriage.
Off they went to the ball.
Once they got there but the man who welcomed the guests said.
When the prince saw her come in he dropped his attention to the stepsisters and all the other women in the room.
He was suddenly struck with awe at this gorgeous creature that had come into the room.
He immediately he went over to her.
He said.
May i have this dance?
Then for the rest of the ball the prince danced all night with cinderella.
But then there was a big clock in the room because cinderella had been told by her stepmother that she could go to the ball.
"But she must come home by twelve of the clock because at twelve of the clock she would go back to being her old self , cinderella the one who dusted the the fireplace."
Now she suddenly looked at the clock.
She said to the prince.
But i have to go.
He said.
She said.
I am sorry i have to.
With that she broke away from him.
"She ran out of the palace , down the steps."
But as she did she lost one of her glass slippers that had been given to her by the fairy godmother.
The mayordomo who was in charge of the guests ran after her and said.
She said.
But she had lost her glass sipper slipper.
But he found it.
He took it.
Cinderella got into her carriage.
I must find her.
So he sent his emissaries out into the village.
He had the glass slipper.
He sent his servant who carried the glass slipper on a pillow.
They went to the houses of all the young women in the land.
They finally got to the home of cinderella.
But cinderella was locked inside a door up high in her room.
But then the footman said.
Let me try the glass slipper on your daughters.
They stuck out their feet.
This was the last family in the whole village that the footman had and his servant had come to.
They said.
You must have another person here because there are not any other young women in the village.
Said said the evil stepmother.
There is one more.
But you would not want her.
He shouted.
So they got cinderella.
They brought her down.
The evil stepmother tried to trip the footman who had the glass slipper on a pillow.
But it was caught in time.
It was put onto the foot of cinderella.
Lo and behold it fit perfectly.
We have found her.
With that the fairy godmother must have appeared again because in the last frame there is cinderella with the prince.
She is once again her beautiful fairy godmother supplied self.
The two of them lived happily ever after.
Oh yes i love to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
First i go to the refrigerator and take out a loaf of oat bread.
I take out one piece of oat bread and put it on a plate.
Before i did that i will have gotten the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly and put those also on the counter.
Now i open the jar of peanut butter.
Then i add jelly also to the same half.
Then i fold it over.
Voila there is my peanut butter sandwich.
That is what i have for lunch everyday almost everyday.
It had been snowing all day.
In fact that was the year when we had the blizzard of nineteen seventy eight.
We had received a whole lot of snow that winter.
So at noon on this day in february when my husband came home from work where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at second presbyterian church he said.
Firstnameca come in the house.
I want to ask you something.
So i said.
So i followed him in taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens.
He said.
So i said.
Okay i am sitting.
What do you have to ask me?
How would you like to go and live in kenya for three years?
I said.
He said.
I said.
Let us go.
So we did.
He had received an invitation to come and work with the national christian council of kenya and a family life education program where he would be responsible for setting up a counselling center in nairobi.
Eventually i got involved in community health in the same organization.
Let us do it.
So four months later we had sold our house our car most of our household possessions with the exception of a few that were stored by a friend.
Our family of four my husband firstnamet our two daughters firstnamem age nine and firstnamec age five and i got on an airplane.
We flew to akron pennsylvania because we were doing this even though we are lutheran in background.
We were invited to do this through a mennonite mission program.
We do not know.
So we were invited to a ten day orientation period in the heart mennonite country in akron pennsylvania where we spent ten marvelous days getting to know the mennonites and also a group of other people who were about to embark on mennonite sponsored mission programs.
So that began a three year period of high adventure for our family.
He gives it a good kick.
It goes whoa through the picture window of a house.
Inside there is a man sitting in his chair.
He is very surprised to see a soccer ball come whopping through his window with probably.
It does break the glass which lands on the floor.
We will say it is.
He gets up.
Now he wants to know who has done this.
So he looks out through the hole of the broken window.
He sees the boy.
We do not have any more pictures here.
But i think the little boy says.
We will assume it is the home of a neighbor.
I am so sorry sir that i broke your window.
But i will work for you to try to replace it.
So that is what he did.
The little boy has his backpack on.
He is getting ready to go to school.
His mom says.
It is going to rain.
You better take an umbrella.
He says.
I do not want to take an umbrella.
But i think you better.
The wetter weather report says it is going to rain.
But he will not do it.
So she said.
Alright but i have told you it is going to rain.
Sure enough pretty soon it starts raining drip drip drip.
Then he he keeps on.
He is he starts to continue.
But then he turns around.
It is raining even harder now.
He runs back home drip drip drip on the kitchen floor.
His mother says.
I told you.
He said.
I do need an umbrella.
He put it up.
Off he went in the rain on his way to school.
Well this is the story of a little girl who has a cat.
One day the dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree.
There the cat sat and would not come down.
As you can see from the picture the dog is still barking.
So of course the cat is not going to come down.
She probably cried and cried.
Finally her father came out and.
The dog is still barking.
So the father said.
Alright i will go up into the tree and get the cat.
So he did.
But the dog is still barking.
It would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage.
But he did not think to do that.
They cannot get as far out as the cat is.
If he did he would surely break the limb.
He would fall.
So as you can see from his expression he is stuck.
Somebody maybe the mother in the house saw what was happening.
She called the fire department.
They are going to put up a ladder against the tree.
Hopefully they will get the dog to go away and rescue the man.
Then after they do that the cat is still up in the tree.
But the dog is no longer barking.
So the cat jumps down.
Once upon a time there was a gentleman whose wife had died.
He had one daughter whose whose name was probably cindy.
This gentleman found another woman and decided to marry her.
She had two daughters as well who were a bit older.
But when the stepmother and the two daughters saw this little girl they said.
We do not you with us.
We are going to call you cinderella.
We will let you sweep the cinders from the hearth.
We do not want you in our lives.
She went out to the barn where she talked with the horse and the dog.
There were some little mice.
She would go out there and talk with them when she was sad.
They all became friends.
One day a letter arrived from the king.
Now the king had a son a handsome son a prince who was in need of a wife.
So the king decided to give a ball and invite all the fair ladies of the land to come to this ball in hopes that the prince would look them all over and find one that he would like to have be his wife.
So the the stepmother and the daughters were thrilled when they got their invitation.
Yes we will go.
You surely said the stepmother will be the one that the prince will choose.
Well cinderella heard about this.
She said.
I can go too.
So she went up to her room in the attic.
She opened her chest.
She pulled out a gown that she had.
She put it on.
She ran down to show it to the the evil stepmother and the two sisters.
They said.
You cannot go to the ball.
They began ripping off the ribbons and the lace.
Cinderella ran back up to the room.
She cried.
I have nothing else that i can wear to this party.
Suddenly the room was filled with light.
There appeared someone she had never seen before.
She asked to the strange apparition.
Yes and i am here to see to it that you too shall go to the ball.
By this time evil stepmother had locked cinderella in the room.
But the little mice came and brought the key and managed to get it the door opened.
Now here was cinderella in her beautiful beautiful white garment with her hair drun done up in the most beautiful hair style you could imagine with jewelry.
So she came down the stairs from her attic.
She appeared downstairs in the living room.
The fairy godmother saw to it that one of the pumpkins in the patch became a beautiful carriage.
She did this by simply waving her wand.
Cinderella said.
The horse suddenly became six horses.
The horses were covered with beautiful plumes.
The dog became the footman.
Off they went to the ball.
They got there after the stepmother and the stepsisters had arrived.
But when cinderella walked into the ballroom the prince saw her.
He gasped.
He just dropped the person he had been dancing with and went over to her and said.
Lovely lady may i have this dance?
She took his hand.
The two of them swirled around the room.
All the rest of the women who were there families settled to the back of the room.
They watched as this beautiful young woman danced the most lovely dance with the handsome prince.
Then the prince said.
I want to keep dancing with you all night.
Which got cinderella to look at the clock.
Now the fairy godmother had told her.
But at the stroke of twelve you will again become cinderella in your tattered clothes.
Coach will wunch once again become the pumpkin.
Everything will go back to how it was.
So cinderella knew that.
She had forgotten.
But now the clock started to tick bong bong.
She said oh to the prince.
But i must go.
Yes i have to go.
I cannot tell you.
Off she dashed down out of the ballroom down the steps.
As she did she fell and one of the glass slippers came off of her feet and landed on the stairs.
But she kept running.
Now she she coach.
Off they went.
All she had left was one glass slipper.
But the other glass slipper remained on the stairs of the ballroom.
This was found by the prince and his the people who who served him.
The prince said.
Well i have this slipper anyway.
We will now go throughout the kingdom.
We will see on whose foot does the slipper fit.
So they went to the house of cinderella and her family.
But cinderella was locked in the room upstairs so that there was no possible chance that she could come to have the slipper tried on her foot.
Then the evil stepsisters tried to fit their big feet into the slipper.
But of course it would not go.
Now the little mice once again had with their key had opened the door.
I would like to try it on.
She said.
She had in her hand the other glass slipper.
So now they had found the beautiful young been at the ball.
She was quickly taken to the palace.
He said.
Will you marry me?
She said.
They lived happily ever.
First i would go to the refrigerator and get out the loaf of oat bread.
Then i would go to the pantry.
I would get out the jar of peanut butter.
Then i would go to the cabinet above our counter and get out the honey.
Then i would open up the loaf of bread.
I would take one piece out and put it on a plate.
Then i would get a knife out of the drawer.
I would open the bottle of peanut butter.
I would dip the knife into the peanut butter.
I would spread peanut butter on the bread.
Then i would get the honey.
Then we have a jar of honey that has a special honey dripper.
With that i would drip the honey onto the bread.
Then i would fold it over in half.
Voila there is my sandwich.
Well i cannot see all of the last picture because you are there.
So i cannot tell what his face is but that is okay.
Oh there i moved you.
He does not have a face.
So it does not matter.
Once upon a time there was a little boy out playing soccer in his yard.
He kicked the ball really hard.
It went right through a neighbors' window and landed and broke a lamp in the neighbor's house.
But he got up.
He looked out.
He saw it was the neighbor boy.
The end bebecause i cannot see his face.
So i do not know if he is really mad or not.
Well there is a little boy going to go to school.
His mother tells him to take an umbrella.
He says.
No i do not need an umbrella.
He leaves.
He goes out the door and says bye mom.
It starts to rain.
He is getting wet.
So he runs home.
Then he has to tell his mom she was right.
Then he took the umbrella to school.
First it looks like a cat ran up a tree and got stuck.
There was a little girl crying and crying.
She could not get him.
So she asked her dad to get him out of the tree.
He got a ladder.
He climbed up in a tree to try to get the cat.
But he could not reach it bebecause the branches were not strong enough.
Then the ladder fell down.
He was stuck.
Her dog went crazy and started barking at him when he was up there.
So they called the fire department.
The fire department came to get him down.
Oh so i do not tell you anything until it is over.
Okay i got it.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella whose mother died when she was little.
She lived with her father.
He decided he would get remarried.
So he married a lady who had two little girls.
They became her stepsisters.
But then he died.
They grew up.
They made her do all the chores in the house.
Well and her stepmother made her do it too.
She had to do all the cooking and the cleaning and taking care of their clothes and doing their laundry.
But then one day she was looking out the window and saw the castle in the distance and thought there had to be something better out there.
Woah and behold they got a letter there was going to be a ball.
It was time for the prince to get married.
The king decided he had to get his son married.
Cinderella wanted to go to the ball.
But her stepmother said.
You have got work to do here.
But cinderella had lots of animal friends from being nice to them and growing up with them.
They the mice and the birds they all made her a beautiful gown.
She put it on.
She ran down to say that she was ready to go to the ball too.
They ripped and they tore her dress.
They she could not go bebecause she did not have anything to wear.
They went off to the ball.
She was crying.
She went up to her room.
She found an old book chest.
Lo and behold she had a fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother decided to help her go to the ball.
So she made her a dress.
Then she made her a carriage and a carriage driver and footmen.
Off she went to to the ball with her beautiful dress and her glass slippers.
She went to the ball.
The prince fell madly in love with her at the ball.
They danced and they danced and they danced.
Then the clock struck midnight.
Oh no cinderella knew that the fairy godmother told her that at midnight all the magic would vanish and she would go back to the way she was before.
So when the clock started striking midnight she ran.
She ran down the stairs and ran away from the castle.
On the way down she lost one of her shoes on the steps.
But she made it out.
She made it home just in time.
All she was left with was one slipper her glass slipper to remind her of the night she had at the castle.
Well the prince was determined that he was going to find his princess the girl who wore the glass slipper.
So they searched all over the countryside to find somebody whose foot would fit the glass slipper.
They went to every house all over the countryside.
They finally got to cinderella's house.
The stepsisters tried on the glass slipper.
But it did not fit them.
So they started to leave when all of a sudden cinderella said.
She tried on the glass slipper.
It fit.
The prince knew he found his princess forever.
Well first i would get everything out of the cupboard.
We would get out peanut butter.
It has to be grape jelly.
Knives and a spoon to get the jelly out.
I would put it all on my counter.
I would get the bread out and get out two pieces of bread.
I lay it on the counter.
Then i would open the peanut butter and use a knife to spread peanut butter on one side of the bread.
Then i would open my jelly and use a spoon to get out jelly and put it on the bread.
I would spread the jelly on the other side of the bread.
Then i would smash them together and then eat it.
I am going to choose a new story.
Right i am going to tell you a different story.
About nineteen ninety nine i took my kids sledding up in troy ohio which is just north of here.
So my husband went too.
We were sledding and we were having a good time on the levee which was a small hill but just about right for a five year old.
We were walking along the top of the hill.
My son slipped and fell and went feet first down the hill.
However he forget to let go of the sled.
So as he went down he pulled the sled behind him.
As he got to the bottom and stopped the sled came down and hit him right in the face.
When i looked out and i saw that there was blood all over the snow by him.
So i ran down and not realizing how bad it was i i picked him up.
Just took him back to our car at which point i looked.
He had a huge gap across his face where the sled had hit him.
So my husband took my daughter home.
I got to rush my son to the children's emergency room.
They took us in right away because obviously he was spatting blood all over the place.
We got to bypass all the people that were there for their runny noses and all the other things in the emergency room.
We went right back in and saw an e r doctor immediately.
Of course they decided that it was too serious for them to deal with.
So they needed to call in a plastic surgeon to work on his face.
So it had to be a pediatric plastic surgeon bebecause my son was only five.
So we just had to sit and wait.
So we waited and we waited.
Try entertaining a five year old in a hospital bed for about eight hours while we waited.
We played all kinds of video games.
We looked at fish in a tank.
He got to the point he stopped bleeding.
So we were just walking around.
And of course we could not eat or drink anything.
Well he could not because they knew he was going to be going into surgery.
So i of course as his mom did not eat or drink anything because i did not want him to see me doing it.
Finally the plastic surgeon came in.
They decided he needed to go in the surgery.
We went into surgery with the doctor one nurse and for some reason me.
I went into surgery with them.
They got out this.
When they got the needle out he of course starts screaming because it was a very long needle.
I for some reason the doctor told me that i am going to need to be the one to hold my son down while he gave him the anesthesia.
So i held him down.
They gave him the shot.
Then i stood up.
Since i had not eaten for eight nine hours and i am diabetic i passed out on the floor of the operating room.
Then they had two patients to deal with.
But they just brought me some orange juice and and had me stand up and continue to help with the surgery.
So they gave him about i think forty two stitches in three layers underneath his nose going from inside his nose down to his lip.
About an hour and a half later we walked out of there.
We went home.
One sunny day a little boy went outside and he decided to kick a soccer ball around.
He was playing and playing.
One time he kicked it too hard.
It went through the window hit the neighbor's lamp and broke it and then crashed right into the neighbor.
So the neighbor got up and got mad and looked out the window and yelled at the little boy for kicking his soccer ball through his window.
One day a little boy was getting ready to go to school.
His mom said.
It is going to rain today.
You better take an umbrella.
The little boy said.
No i do not want an umbrella.
He went out the door and started to walk to school.
But halfway there it started to rain.
It started sprinkling just at first.
Then it started raining harder and harder.
So he ran home soaking wet.
His mom said.
I told you so.
Then he took the umbrella.
He went back to school.
Once upon a time a little girl was playing outside riding her tricycle with her cat and her dog.
Her cat got away from her and ran up and got stuck in a tree.
So she called for her dad because the cat was stuck in the tree.
So her dad went and got a ladder and climbed up in the tree to try to go get the cat.
But the cat got scared and ran out on the tiny little branch.
The dad could not reach it.
When he was trying to move the ladder fell over.
He could not get down.
At that time the girl's dog went crazy and started barking at the dad and the cat and the tree.
So they hadta call nineoneone.
The firemen came with their ladder.
They saved the day.
They got the dad down.
They got the cat down.
She lived alone with her dad in the little village because her mother died when she was young.
One day her dad decided that he needed to get married again so that she would have a mother.
So he met and he married a widow that had two small girls of her own.
All things seemed good at first.
But she was okay until cinderella's dad died.
Then the stepmother got very very mean.
They made cinderella do everything around the house.
She hadta do all the cooking and the cleaning and the mending and the laundry everything while the stepsisters sat around and and did nothing.
Well one day she was looking out at the hill.
She saw the beautiful castle up on the hill.
She dreamed about what it would be like to live in a castle someday.
But she hadta go back to all her work more cooking more cleaning.
But she was such a nice and gentle person that all the animals loved her and talked to her.
All the mice and the horses and the dogs and the cat everyone loved her so much.
Well up at the castle there was a prince.
The king who was the prince's father decided it was time for the prince to get married.
So he and his advisors decided to have a ball for the prince to meet all the eligible women in the kingdom so he could pick his bride.
So they sent out invitations to the whole country for everyone with eligible brides or girls to come to the ball.
Cinderella's house got an invitation too.
Both stepsisters thought it would just sure be her that the prince would choose.
So they used cinderella to help them get ready get their dresses get everything ready.
Cinderella wanted to go too.
But she did not have time to get herself ready.
So the animals got ready for her.
They made her a dress and did her hair and got her all ready to go.
She ran downstairs to go to the ball.
But her stepmother would not let her go.
She said that only the stepsisters could go.
She rips cinderella's dress.
She went back to her room.
She cried and she cried.
Lo and behold what appeared but her fairy godmother.
Her fairy godmother said.
Cinderella you can go to the ball.
She used magic to make her a new dress.
Off she went to the ball in the brand new dress that the fairy godmother had made by magic for her.
Especially important was she was wearing beautiful glass slippers on her feet.
So she went to the ball.
The minute she entered the ball the prince had eyes for noone but cinderella.
They danced and they danced and they danced.
They had a wonderful time.
Uhoh but then the clock struck midnight.
The fairy godmother had warned cinderella that the magic would only last until midnight.
So the clock started striking midnight.
Cinderella had to run before the prince saw that she was not really a princess.
She ran down the stairs to her carriage and hopped in just in time before the magic went away.
But she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run.
So she went home.
But he knew he had her glass slipper.
So he decided to search the countryside for whosoever foot would fit the glass slipper.
Whoever fit it would become his bride.
They went around.
Noone's foot would fit the glass slipper until they got to cinderella's house.
Both stepsisters tried.
But their feet would not fit.
Finally they tried it on cinderella.
Her foot fit perfectly.
She and the prince got married and lived happily ever after.
I keep talking.
Well being the the methodical ocd person that i am first i get everything out on my counter.
I get out the bread.
I get out the peanut butter.
I get out the jelly.
Or in my case i used grape jelly.
I get out two knives and a plate.
First i get open the bread.
I get out two pieces of bread.
I put one on a plate and actually one on a napkin.
I open the peanut butter.
I use a knife to spread peanut butter on one half of the bread.
Then i open the jelly use the spoon to get out a spoonful of jelly and use the second knife to spread the jelly on the other piece of bread.
Then i smash them together.
Well actually and then i cut it in half.
Then i eat it.
Okay well probably my first major event was having my first child i mean because that was entirely new to me.
I mean it was a great transition from being pregnant.
So i had a easy pregnancy all the way through.
I am fascinated by just the act of giving birth.
The next day you have this child.
I remembered after you know going into the hospital.
I did not read up anything about it.
I just went in kind of blind.
You know right when the contractions started happening i was like.
Oh this is going to hurt.
But at first i thought.
Oh i should have read a lot more about this event.
Then i had a child.
I mean it changed my world from night and day.
So the little boy is playing soccer in his backyard.
He kicks the ball through his neighbor's window.
It lands on neighbor's lap through the busted window.
The neighbor is looking outside to see who kicked the ball through his window.
Okay so the mom is telling the little boy that he needs the umbrella to walk to school.
The boy is saying.
No mom i do not need the umbrella.
He starts walking to school.
It starts to rain.
It is raining harder.
He realizes he should have listened to his mother because he did not take the umbrella.
So he goes back home and grabs the umbrella.
Well there is a little girl whose cat climbed up the tree and has gotten stuck in the tree.
Her dad went to rescue the kittycat out of the tree.
But he has gotten stuck in the tree as well.
So the fire department was called.
They are going to rescue both the dad and the cat in the tree.
A long time ago in a land far away there was a little girl and her dad.
I believe her mom had passed away.
Her dad ended up marrying another woman with two daughters.
They brought the families together.
The stepmother favored her children over cinderella and gave her children all the privileges and made cinderella work day in and day out.
The prince was having a ball to choose his future wife.
They received an invitation at all the households in the land.
When the time came the wicked stepmother would not let cinderella go.
She had to do the chores.
But her daughters could go.
They had beautiful dresses.
But she banished cinderella into doing chores.
Cinderella was dreaming that she could go to the ball.
She had a fairy godmother appear.
She turned her garb into a nice ballgown and a punkin into a chariot and a steed.
She got to go to the ball.
At the ball the prince noticed her right away.
They danced the night away.
When the clock struck twelve she was sposta be home.
She heard the bells ringing.
She ran off from the prince before he ever got her name.
So she made it home.
Her stepmother and stepsisters did not even know she had gone to the ball.
But the prince was determined to find out who he was dancing with all night long.
So in her haste of leaving the ball she dropped one of her slippers.
So the prince sent around the slipper throughout the town and wanted to find out the foot that would fit the glass slipper.
When they came to their house both stepsisters tried it on.
It would not fit.
Cinderella said.
I would like to try it on.
So regrettingly they let cinderella try on the slipper.
It fit.
Her and her prince lived happily ever after.
First you go in the pantry and get out a loaf of bread and the peanut butter.
Then you would get in the fridge and get out your jelly.
You take out two slices of bread.
With the knife you would spread the peanut butter over one half and the jelly over the next half.
I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when i gave birth to my first daughter firstnamek.
So i really do not go to the doctors.
I do not like to go to doctors.
That is kind of how i took that whole pregnancy.
I did not read a lot about it.
I just went through it because i mean i was fine the whole way.
Then when we got to the hospital i had to be induced.
So i mean i did not read anything about being induced.
So i did not really know know what i was signing up for.
But when we walked into that hospital i mean i got panicked because i did not know anything.
She came up.
She saw my doctor.
I remember the first thing she said.
She goes.
But i really did not think anything about it.
Then i started getting nervous.
I thought.
I wonder how many baby she is delivered.
I mean i think i was in labor eight hours.
But i did not know what to expect.
I really did not know what the procedures were.
Then it went very smoothly.
Then just having a child and having it placed on my stomach.
I mean my husband and i we were both just bawling because we could not believe we brought a baby into the world.
So that for me was a very life changing altering work of god you know.
He kicked the soccer ball extremely hard and broke his neighbor's window with the ball.
The ball landed on his neighbor's lap.
The neighbor looked out the broken window to see who had kicked the ball.
One day a little boy was going out to play.
His mother told him he needed to take an umbrella because it was going to rain that day.
But the little boy said he was okay.
He did not need an umbrella because it was not raining at the present time.
He got on his walk to school.
It started to rain.
Then it started to rain even harder.
"So he ran home , explained to his mom that he got caught in the rain."
He picked up the umbrella and proceeded to walk to school.
So there was a cat that got stuck in a tree.
The little girl went to have her dad get the cat out of the tree.
He climbed up the tree to retrieve the cat.
He got stuck.
The mom who is not in the picture called the fire department to rescue both the dad and the cat up in the tree.
Okay the story of cinderella begins with cinderella herself and her dad.
Her mom had passed away.
Her dad found a new wife who also had two daughters.
So as they were blending these families together cinderella spent a lot of time with her stepmother.
But her stepmother favored her children over cinderella and had cinderella do all the chores in their house.
The stepsisters did not really have to do any chores.
But cinderella never complained.
She made friends with all the animals around the house and was just a happygolucky girl.
One day there was going to be a big ball at the castle.
All the young maidens in the land were invited to attend the celebration.
But cinderella's stepmother said she could not go because she did not have a proper dress.
But her stepsisters were going to go.
They had the best dresses around.
Cinderella found her trunk with a dress.
But her mother said it it was not suitable to go.
So cinderella was crying with her animal friends.
Out of nowhere appeared her fairy godmother who turned her dress into a beautiful ballgown and turned her animal friends into the carriage and the horse and the driver.
So she attended the ball.
But her fairy godmother had one statement for her.
That all the dress and the carriage would expire at midnight.
So she hadta leave the dance before midnight.
So she went to the dance.
She danced with the prince.
They had a wonderful time.
She saw the clock was getting close to being midnight.
So she left in a hurry because she did not want her gown to change back to just a plain old dress.
At that time she accidentally lost her glass slipper.
But she returned to her house and told her animal friends all about the dance and meeting the prince.
Well unbeknownst to her the prince had kept the glass slipper.
He wanted to find out who the maiden was that wore that glass slipper.
So they took the glass slipper all through town to see whose foot would fit in the glass slippers.
When they came to her house both her stepsisters tried on the slipper.
It would not fit.
So cinderella came and said.
May i try it on?
She did.
It fit.
Her and her prince lived happily ever after.
First you go to your cabinet.
You take out the bread and the peanut butter.
You need two slices of bread for the sandwich.
You need a knife.
You spread the peanut butter over one slice of the bread.
Then you go in the refrigerator and get out your grape jelly.
You put it on the other side of the bread.
You close the two halves together.
When i was a senior in high school i was homecoming queen.
I remember being out on the football field you know with my dad and the court.
They announced that i was queen.
I just remember getting crowned.
Then as i started walking through them they all got up and screamed and jumped and jumped on me and my dad.
There once was a boy named max who loved to play soccer.
He would always play in his yard and kick the ball and try and shoot goals.
One day when he was kicking the ball he accidentally hit the neighbor's window.
The ball went right through the window and landed in the owner's lap after it knocked down a lamp.
So the owner got up.
He just went and stood at his window.
He yelled out the window and said.
Max what happened?
Max said.
I will go get my parents so we can work this out.
His mom said.
Oh i think it is going to rain today.
You better take your umbrella.
He said.
No i do not need my umbrella.
I am just going to go without it.
Then as soon as he left it started raining.
He was getting all wet.
So he ran back home.
His mom looked very disappointed in him bebecause he was all wet.
But then he got his umbrella.
Then he went and walked to school.
Once upon a time there was a cat that climbed up in a tree.
He sat up in the tree because he could not get down.
She rode her tricycle out by the tree to try and get him to come down.
So dad came out and brought his ladder.
But he could not get to the cat.
Because he was up in the tree his dog was barking and barking bebecause he was scared he would not be able to come down.
So i think the mom was in the house.
So she called the fire department.
The fire truck came with the ladder.
They put the ladder up on the tree and were able to get the cat down first.
They gave it to the little girl.
Then they helped the man down.
When he got to the ground he pet his dog.
Once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella.
Her father was going to marry another woman who had two daughters.
So he brought her over to their house to meet them.
They did not want her because she was beautiful.
So they were called the evil stepsisters.
So the mom put cinderella to work while the girls just got to do whatever they wanted.
Cinderella had to serve them tea and bring them whatever they needed and do all the housework.
She never complained.
She just made friends with all the little animals.
She just went along her merry way.
Until one day the mom got a letter saying there was going to be a ball because i think the prince needed to find a wife.
Cinderella heard this invitation and assumed she would get to go.
So she went back to her room.
She got out her chest of stuff.
She got her dress out.
She hung it up.
Her and the birds helped her make a beautiful dress.
She got all ready.
At the same time the stepsisters were getting all ready.
When they all met to go to the ball the stepsisters started ripping her dress and breaking her necklace and saying.
You are not going to go.
So the mom said.
You cannot go.
So the girls went off the stepsisters and went to the ball.
Her fairy godmother appeared.
She did her little magic with her wand and made a carriage to take cinderella into the ball.
But before that she did her magic and gave her a beautiful white gown and some glass slippers to wear.
So cinderella got in the little carriage.
She made it out of a pumpkin.
But the one thing was she had to be back by midnight.
If she was not that is when everything was going to go back to what it was.
Her old ripped dress and the carriage would be gone.
She all of a sudden realized it was midnight.
The clock started chiming.
She ran.
When she was running down the steps to get to her carriage one of her glass slippers fell off.
So she got in the carriage.
It went back home.
Then poof she was with the animals in her old ripped dress.
She went back to her house.
Then the next day someone from the castle came with the glass slipper because they wanted to find who the shoe fit.
The stepsisters had huge feet.
They would not fit into the glass slipper.
They did not want cinderella to try it on.
But she did.
The glass slipper fit her.
So they took her to the castle to be with the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
First i would get out the bread peanut butter from the cabinet and jelly from my refrigerator and put it on the counter.
I would probably get a paper plate out and then get a knife from the silverware drawer.
I would open the bread and take out two slices and put ththem on my plate.
I would take my knife and get some peanut butter and spread it on one of the slices until i had enough.
Then i would close the peanut butter.
Then i would open the jelly.
Put in on the other slice or even on top of the peanut butter and put as much jelly i wanted.
Then i would put the knife down and put the two pieces of bread together.
I like my sandwiches cut.
So i would cut it in half.
Then i would eat it.
I am going to share a different story.
Something important was having my first child.
It also happened to be when my husband was.
He was turning thirty.
I felt so good the whole time i was pregnant.
I loved being pregnant.
I decided i was having a surprise party for him on september seventeenth a saturday.
Well i went into my doctor on friday the sixteenth.
I forget why.
I forget why i hadta go get checked in.
But she made me go to the hospital and get checked in.
Or i cannot remember.
Not get checked in but just to have some tests done.
When they looked at me they said i was already you know dilated.
If i wanted to i could just stay.
They thought i would go into labor.
So i stayed and had firstnamej my daughter the next day at three.
So my husband is you know in the room with me.
We have our baby firstnamej.
I said.
Well there is one thing.
Or i think it was the day before.
Yeah i was having the party on the eighteenth.
I had her on the seventeenth.
But i said.
I brought it to the hospital.
You have to call everyone and tell ththem we are not having a party.
He said.
Cannot we still have it bebecause we were going to be going home the next day.
No we cannot still have it.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named kevin.
He loved to play soccer.
He would play outside in the yard just kicking the ball around trying to juggle it and beat his record every day.
One day he decided to kick it farther.
He accidentally kicked it through his window.
His dad was sitting inside the window in his chair.
It scared him because the ball came through crashing and knocked over the lamp.
"So his dad picked up the ball , looked out the window and called kevin and asked him to come in."
They talked about it.
Kevin was going to start playing in the backyard so he would not break any of the front windows again.
His mom told him he needed to take his umbrella.
He said.
No mom i do not want my umbrella.
I am just going to go without it.
So he walked outside.
It starting raining.
He was getting all wet and splashing through puddles.
He ran back inside to go tell his mom.
She was kind of upset with him because she tried to get him to take it in the first place.
But he did not.
So she gave him the umbrella.
He walked outside with his umbrella now and walked to school.
I did this one last week.
Once upon a time this little girl named rebecca had a cat.
He decided to run outside and and climb up in a tree.
She got stuck.
So she went outside to try and get him her.
I do not know if it was a boy or a girl cat.
But rebecca was calling for the cat to come down.
She rode her tricycle out to the tree.
Her dad followed her out as well as her dog.
The dog was barking at the dad because the dad climbed up the tree and was trying to get the cat.
But he got stuck.
She called the fire department because noone could get the cat down.
Now the cat and the dad are stuck in the tree.
So the firetruck drove up.
Two firemen came with a ladder to help everyone get down.
The dad the daughter and the animals all went back inside the house.
I would not know which ones.
So i think.
I think i am okay.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella.
Her dad remarried a woman that had two daughters and a cat.
So the stepmom made cinderella do all the work.
So she would bring the stepsisters tea.
She would do their laundry.
She would do all the cleaning.
She would do all the work.
The stepsisters did not do anything.
She made friends with all the animals.
One time the cat came and was being mean.
She got him away from s and told him to you know leave them alone and be nice.
She was always just doing nice things.
One day she was just looking out her window.
She would admire the beautiful castle in the background.
There was a prince that lived at the castle that they wanted to marry off.
So one day the people from the castle came and brought a letter stating that all all the girls were going to be invited to go to a ball.
Cinderella heard the stepmom reading the letter and got very excited and so did the stepsisters.
So cinderella went back to her room.
She had a dress in her hope chest.
She had a book that showed pictures of other dresses.
So she decided to fix up her dress.
So she hung it on her closet.
She added a sash.
The birds helped her.
The mice helped her.
She made a beautiful dress.
When it was time to go to the ball she went downstairs.
The evil stepsisters did not want her to go to the ball because she was so beautiful.
They wanted to marry the prince one of them.
So they went after her.
Even the stepmom was angry that cinderella looked so beautiful.
So one of the sisters grabbed cinderella's necklace and broke it.
One of them grabbed the sash and ripped it.
They left and went to the ball bebecause cinderella could not go like that.
She was crying.
Her fairy godmother showed up.
So she created.
What is it called?
A i cannot think of the word.
She used her magic wand and said gave cinderella a beautiful white dress.
Cinderella was getting into the carriage.
The fairy godmother said.
You have to be home by midnight.
Once the clock strikes twelve everything will return to what it was.
So cinderella went to the ball and was asked to dance with the prince.
They were dancing.
The evil stepsisters were watching.
But at midnight when the clock struck twelve even though cinderella was having a wonderful time she had to take off.
She started running down the stairs.
The prince's people that help him followed her.
She left one of her glass slippers.
It fell off.
So she kept running and got in her carriage and made it back.
At at after the clock struck twelve everything turned back.
She was sitting in the woods where she turned into all of that and with her animal friends.
So they she got in so much trouble that they locked her in her room.
They were going to take it to all the women in the kingdom and try it on.
So cinderella knew they were at her castle.
So two little mice brought her the key to her room.
But before that the stepmom knew it was cinderella's glass slipper.
So she tried to trip the guy that was holding the pillow with the glass slipper on it.
But luckily he caught it.
So this evil stepsisters tried it on.
When cinderella got out of her room because the mice gave her the key she went down.
So cinderella got to marry the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
She got away from all those mean stepsisters and stepmom.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would first get a plate out of the cabinet.
I would get the bread peanut butter and jelly.
So i would open the bread get out two pieces of bread and put ththem on the plate.
I would open the peanut butter.
But i need a knife.
So i would go to my drawer and get a knife and scoop out peanut butter.
I would spread it on one slice of bread.
Depending on how much you want you can put however much you want.
Then i would close the lid to the peanut butter.
Then i would open the jelly and take my knife and scoop it out and put it on the other piece of bread.
Again you can do that as many times as you need so you get as much jelly as you want.
Then once i have my jelly i would close my jelly.
Then i would put the two pieces of bread together and probably cut it in half bebecause i like to cut ththem in half.
Then i would put everything away the bread the peanut butter and the jelly.
The jelly would go back in the fridge.
But the bread and the peanut butter go back in the cabinet.
Then i would eat it.
I will give you my easiest one because it is freshest in my mind.
In december my daughter and her fianc moved in because they were sposta get married in march.
So she they were going to stay here so we could finish planning the wedding while they were in town.
Then the coronavirus happened.
A week before her wedding we decided to postpone it.
But so now we are retrying to get them motivated to.
They picked the date.
They just have to get out the invitations.
So we are working through keeping somehow motivated and hoping for the best.
So we have picked an august date.
Now we get to go back and redo some of the things that we have done like seating charts and things with the date on it.
So i am looking forward to that.
So then they can move out and take their next exciting adventure.
There was a little boy who was outside.
Well i do not want to say little boy.
There was a teenager that was outside playing soccer.
He kicked the ball really hard.
It went over the bushes and went through the neighbor man's window right on into his living room where he was sitting.
It knocked over the lamp.
So the man picked up the ball to look outside.
But then i think he is thinking.
Yeah i remember what it was like to be a boy.
This happens.
So i will give him back his ball.
One morning a little boy was getting ready for to leave for school.
Then his mom said.
He says.
I do not need any umbrella.
He walks out.
She gave him a look like.
You are going to need it.
Then he went outside.
It started raining.
He ran back home.
He said to his mom.
She has her hands on her hips and a scolding face.
But she still gave him an umbrella.
Then he finished walking to school.
So there was a spotted cat that was being chased by a dog.
It ran up a tree.
A little girl came outside and was upset.
So she jumped off of her bicycle and tried to get the kitty to come down.
So she got her dad.
Her dad came to try to help get the cat down.
He climbed up the tree.
He ended up getting stuck on the tree.
Then the fire department came with the ladder and hopefully got them down.
Cinderella's father met a woman.
She had two daughters of her own that were about the same age as cinderella.
His dad decided to marry the woman.
Then the dad died.
The stepmother raised the three girls two of her own and her stepdaughter cinderella.
She treated cinderella like a maid and not really like the way she treated her two favorite daughters.
Cinderella had to scrub the floors and keep everything clean and cook and was not allowed to do a lot of things that the girls were doing.
They lived in a kingdom that had a king.
He had a son that was a prince.
The king wanted to find a woman to be the princess for his son a bride.
Then they decided to hold a ball that they would invite all the eligible ladies in the kingdom to come to.
So a notice was sent out.
The stepmother read the notice.
Then the stepmother had beautiful dresses for her two daughters but not cinderella.
Cinderella with the help of her forest friends or her animal friends and fairy godmother made a a beautiful dress.
Well i guess the fairy godmother did not help that yet.
Well cinderella made a dress.
Then she was planning to go.
The stepmother said.
No you are not going anywhere.
You are going to stay home and clean the house.
We are going to the ball.
She had her dress kind of tore up by the stepsisters.
Then everyone left for the ball except for cinderella.
Then she made a wish.
She granted her wish to to that she would get to go to the ball.
So using the forest animals they created a everything she needed a beautiful gown.
They turned the pumpkin into a coach.
They changed the mice into horses.
Everybody participated.
But the thing is they told her she had to be home by midnight when the clock struck midnight because the magic would wear off.
So cinderella went to the ball.
She came in.
Since it was a kind of a masquerade kind of ball to not everybody knew who.
Depends on which version you watch.
So she went in.
Everyone danced with the prince.
The prince fell in love with cinderella and wanted to dance the night away with her.
But she noticed it was getting close to midnight.
So she was leaving the ball.
He was chasing her.
Then when she was on the steps she had lost one of her glass slippers which miraculously did not change back into what it was prior.
She got to the carriage just as it was striking midnight.
Then on her way home it changed back into forest animals and vegetables with pumpkins.
But she got home.
They could not believe who this girl was who was at the ball that they were not treated like they were the fairest of them all.
Then the prince wanted to find out who it was that was at the ball since noone knew who cinderella was.
He decided to go on a search for the love of his life by having all the girls in the kingdom try on a glass slipper.
They searched.
They searched.
Then finally stopped at the the house where cinderella and her family lived.
They tried the slippers on the sisters.
Who each of the girls tried to shove their feet in them.
But they did not fit.
Then they whined.
Then they were not going to try anybody else bebecause they did not know about cinderella.
Then somebody in his party saw her.
They tried it on.
They said.
No we have to try it on her.
The stepmother says.
They tried it on her.
It fit.
Then they fell in love.
Cinderella got to move away from the wicked stepmother.
Then the prince lived happily ever after.
Hopefully cinderella did not talk to her stepsisters anymore.
Yeah yeah hopefully they lived happily ever after.
The day my granddaughter was born.
My husband and myself live in florida.
Our son and daughter inlaw live in ohio.
We happened to know that her due date was january first.
So we went up early for christmas.
We were going to go visit them.
But we stopped in cleveland first where my father inlaw lives.
My son and daughter inlaw live in columbus.
My daughter had also flown in from florida.
She just got there the night before.
We stayed up really late.
Then we woke up in the morning.
We were going to go do stuff.
We got a call that said her water broke and that the baby was coming.
"So we jumped in the car , drove two and a half hours to columbus and made it there before the baby was born."
Then getting the text that the baby was born.
We got to go see the baby.
We got to actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we could not be off.
The teenage boy it looks like was playing in the field with a soccer ball.
He kicked it really hard.
It went over the bushes into the neighborhood guy's yard.
It went through his window where he was sitting in his living room.
The ball knocked over them and broke the lamp.
"Then he looked outside saw the kid playing out there , knew the ball belonged to him."
He was deciding whether he wanted to give the ball back to him or not or how he was going to get his window fixed.
But hopefully he just gave the kid back his ball and fixed his window and remembered what it was like to be a boy.
Little boy was going off to school.
His mom told him to take an umbrella with him because it was supposed to rain.
The little boy said.
I do not need an umbrella.
It is not going to rain today.
The mom said.
Okay you can go.
But it is going to rain.
He went outside.
It started raining.
He turned around.
He came back and was like.
Oh i should have listened to you the first time mom.
She said.
Yes you should have listened.
You would not have gotten all wet.
Well then she gave johnny the little umbrella.
He went back out to school and stayed dryer.
I am going to go with spring bebecause i like that better.
She saw a cat up in a tree.
She looked.
Then she saw a dog barking at the bottom of the tree.
So she was trying to tell the cat that it was okay.
Let me help you.
But she could not get the cat out of the tree.
So she got her dad who brought a ladder.
The dad climbed up the tree.
The ladder fell down.
So he could not get down again.
The cat and the dad were stuck in the tree.
The fire department came with the ladder of their own.
They were working to get the man and the cat down safely and not get bit by the dog.
Hopefully they did that.
Cinderella when cinderella was little she her father married a new woman and that became her stepmother.
She had two daughters of her own that were about the same age as cinderella.
She treated cinderella like the maid instead of like a daughter and treated her daughters like princesses because that is what she wanted them to become.
She had a very good heart.
She just did the things she was supposed to do and try to keep herself happy.
She found out that there was an announcement being made by the king that the prince was going to be hosting a ball with hopes to find his future bride.
When the mother read it the girls were all excited and started getting their dresses together.
Cinderella helped get their dresses together help them get together.
Quietly she made her own dress.
She got dressed to go to the ball that day.
The stepmother said.
Oh no you are not going.
You have to stay home and clean the house and get things together.
Noone would want you anyways.
So then the stepsisters left for the ball.
Cinderella went to her room and was crying.
Her fairy godmother showed up and helped her create a new dress.
A pumpkin turned into a coach to take her to the ball.
The fairy godmother made cinderella a pair of glass slipper shoes to wear to the ball.
So cinderella secretly went to the ball without anybody knowing.
She showed up at the ball and came down the steps.
The prince saw her and was by enchanted by her.
They danced.
The one rule that the fairy godmother told her was everything will turn back into what it was originally at the stroke of midnight so to make sure that she was home by the stroke of midnight.
She heard the chimes and ran out leaving the prince standing there.
The prince chased after her.
But he could not catch her.
As she was running she lost one of the glass slippers.
She got back to the coach and was on her way home was almost there.
Everything turned back into what it was originally.
So then the prince found the slipper on the step.
He insisted that his royal staff help him find the woman that it belonged to because he knew that was the woman for him.
So they did a search.
They went to all the houses and tried it on all the girls.
They tried it on the two two stepsisters.
It did not fit them.
Then they said.
Then the prince saw cinderella standing behind in the background that we had not tried it on her.
The stepmother said.
Oh it will not fit her.
Then he tried it on her anyways.
It fit.
The prince and cinderella lived happily ever after.
A knife to spread it with.
Because of the covid nineteen this is had to be postponed.
It is still up in the air as far as if the a wedding is ever going to take place.
My daughter currently lives with me.
She is having a rough time with it too.
But we are going to get through this.
I do uber delivery eats.
It was something that i just started to do just to yeah.
So just recently they opened up the golf courses down here.
So i did go golfing last monday.
Well looks like the little boy's playing outside playing with the soccer ball.
He accidentally kicked the ball through the window and landed on dad's lap.
You are going to be grounded.
Well mom says.
The boy says.
I do not need no umbrella.
I am going out in the rain.
Mom says.
I told you so.
So now he went out in the rain with the umbrella.
Well looks like a little girl lost her cat in the tree.
Somebody called for help.
Fire department showed up.
It looks like there is a gentleman who tried to climb up the tree and was unable to get the cat.
They lived near a kingdom where the king lived and his son which was the prince.
They were having a party.
They were inviting cinderella and her family to the kingdom for the ball.
The letter came from the king.
The mother told cinderella she had to stay home and clean the house.
She was not allowed to go ball.
She was i think the ugly sister or the the sister that did not belong.
So the mother and the two sisters went to the ball.
Cinderella decided that she was going to go to the ball.
She got her beautiful dress on.
The fairy godmother showed up and turned her pumpkin and her rodents into a stage coach.
Cinderella went to the ball.
Her sisters and mother were very upset why she showed up to the ball.
Prince saw her.
They ended up dancing.
The when the clock struck twelve she would turn back into cinderella with no beautiful dress.
Or the stagecoach would shrink back to a pumpkin.
The animals would go back to from horses to rodents.
The prince was very upset he could not find cinderella.
Cinderella ran out the door.
She lost her slipper or her shoe.
The prince found it on the boardwalk.
He wanted to find out where this woman went to and who she was.
He searched the whole city finally taking the shoe to every woman to every house in the city.
Finally he finds cinderella.
Once he found cinderella he made her his queen.
Awesome i just did that last week.
Well i opened the loaf of bread with the tie.
I opened my jar of peanut butter and spread one side.
I open my jar of jelly.
I spread that right on top of my peanut butter.
Then i took my other piece of bread and put it on top of that.
Then i ate it.
Well let us do a happy story today.
That i have two beautiful grandchildren.
I have a three year old granddaughter and a one year old grandson that came into my life.
As a grandfather you really do not realize you know what the grandkids do to you as far as your heart.
The love that comes.
By the time we got to the hospital it was three hours.
But my daughter inlaw she went through it with a birthing mother.
I ended up with a beautiful grandbaby.
Looks like a little boy is playing outside with his soccer ball.
He accidentally hit the ball through the window.
Ball ended up landing on his father's lap.
His father started yelling out the window.
You are grounded.
A mother telling her little son to take the umbrella bebecause it is going to rain.
The son says.
Nah mom i do not need an umbrella.
He goes out.
He turns around goes back home.
Tells mom i am soaking wet.
She gives him the umbrella.
Well it looks like a little girl lost her cat.
She looks like she rode her bicycle to the tree.
She found the cat in the tree.
Looks like somebody was trying to save the cat climbing in the tree but unable to.
Looks like she brought her dog with her.
Looks like somebody contacted the firemen to help save the cat.
The firemen showed up with a ladder.
Hopefully they save the cat.
I guess they were always dreamed about going to the kingdom.
The one day the prince wanted to have a party.
So the king sent out all letters to all the families that were invited to this ball.
Cinderella got an invite.
All her sisters were laughing at her.
Her mother was laughing at her saying that you are not going.
You are not allowed to go.
You must stay behind and clean the house.
So the sisters and the mother get all dressed up to go to this ball at the kingdom.
Cinderella was staying behind having to clean the house.
She decided that she was going to try to go to the ball anyway.
She had a very pretty dress that she kept dreaming about.
One day the her fairy godmother showed up.
Told her that she could go to the ball.
So she magically turned her into a princess with a beautiful gown.
She turned the pumpkin into a carriage and some furry friends into horses.
Off she went to the kingdom.
She showed up to the kingdom.
The prince asked her to dance.
They ended up dancing all night.
Cinderella knew at midnight that she would not be in her dress anymore.
Her and her stage would return to a pumpkin.
So she ran out the front door of the kingdom on her way home.
The prince was chasing her.
Cinderella lost her silver slipper.
The prince found the slipper.
He decided that he was going to scour the town and find out who was wearing that silver slipper.
Eventually he went door to door.
Her mean mother said.
No this there is no way it could be her.
The prince he was determined to try her foot anyway.
He put the slipper on cinderella's foot.
Lo and behold it matched.
He asked her to come back to the kingdom and marry her.
They ended up getting married and living happily ever after.
Well i open the loaf of bread.
I get two slices of bread out.
I lay it on the plate.
I get the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly.
I spread my peanut butter on both sides of the bread.
Then i will spread my pink jelly on top of one slice of the bread.
Then i will just put ththem together and make my sandwich.
There is so many different different levels of importance like getting something i ordered online that showed up.
Oh great i got this thing now i can do something with.
Possibly time i flew an airplane myself always something.
You go with your instructor for twenty hours or thirty hours or something of instruction.
It varies.
I do not remember exactly.
So i would have to go back in my log book and look that up but how many hours it was.
But but the first time that you do a your first solo is definitely memorable because there is nobody else there to remind you that.
And there is nobody to tell you.
There is noone to say.
Have you mentioned to the tower that you are on approach to landing?
It was just you know hundreds of things that you do which is not that different than than the thousands and things you do in a car between home and work that any one of which could could kill you.
But when it is the first time flying on your own without anybody to point out the hundred things that you are doing that could result in significant trouble n exciting experience.
I ended up talking to my instructor anyway and told him.
I am putting in fifteen degrees of flaps.
I am adjusting the trim.
And just doing all the things that you do.
Then realize that you did it without your instructor.
You did not crash or anything like that.
But that is that is something that probably everybody remembers who is a pilot.
But i also ride motorcycles.
Motorcycles is something that you really want to not think about anything else or at least not very much because it is a lot easier than a car to to get in major trouble.
Looks like jeff is practicing playing soccer and broke the window.
Irate homeowner has the ball and is possibly yelling at the perpetrator through the broken window.
Well it looks like molly is telling her mom she does not need an umbrella today.
She will go without it.
She goes out.
It is raining.
She is getting really really wet.
Mom said.
I told ya you needed an umbrella.
Well it started out when when diva the cat went outside and does not go outside very often or in fact really has not been outside in years.
Immediately the neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree where the cat ran to an outer branch and felt safe that the dog was not going to be able to get her out there.
Well then jo realized the cat was in the tree and rode her tricycle out to to try to get the cat out of the tree.
But she could not reach the cat.
So she called her dad.
"Her dad put a ladder up , went part way up the tree and could not reach the cat."
The ladder fell down.
Well someone called nineoneone.
The fire department came.
Once upon a time there was a unpleasant woman with two unpleasant daughters who apparently was given a very nice daughter by a mysterious gentleman who did not want to take care of her anymore.
The two unpleasant daughters did not do much of the work around the house and were unpleasant to the nice daughter who was stuck having to do all the unpleasant tasks around the house but had some robot mice to keep her company who helped a lot with her sanity in this unpleasant situation.
Meanwhile at the castle the prince is being badgered by his odd looking father that he must have a wife to be a princess so that the evil patriarchy can continue on through history of rule of the land.
The prince is going to have a big party and invite all the eligible young women in the land.
So a declaration is set out.
There is going to be a great ball at which occasion the prince will will observe and perhaps dance with all the hopefully eligible young women of the nation.
As this happens the unfortunate nice daughter learns a bit and thinks maybe she could go.
In an old chest she finds an old book which may or may not have anything to do with the story.
But she also finds a great dress that she can wear.
Now the evil daughters they see her thinking that she has plans to go.
You are just the the ugly daughter who does all the chores.
You are not going to go to a great ball.
So they and the unpleasant mother head off to the ball to have a great time and hopefully attract the prince's attention and and and have things go their way.
But meanwhile the the nice daughter stuck with all the terrible chores in the household is visited by a fairy godmother who realizes that there is a big problem.
She decides that she needs the help.
She gives the pretty nice and badly treated daughter a beautiful dress and takes her to the ball.
Of course the prince sees that there is this beautiful and virtuous woman who he is never met before.
He wants to know who she is.
They dance.
They they have a wonderful time.
But pretty soon the clock shows it is almost midnight.
According to the legal stipulations of her contract with the fairy godmother she must be home before twelve or else her beautiful carriage drawn by the goofiest horses ever will suddenly turn into a pumpkin.
So she rushes home.
At some point the carriage does turn into a pumpkin.
I believe i kind of lost it there.
But she gets home.
On the way home she lost one of her beautiful slippers.
She does not realize it at the time but that is actually a good thing to lose a slipper because in the following days the prince who is very upset because this woman who was the most charming and wonderful woman at the ball he would like to see her again.
He would like her to become princess.
But she vanished.
The only thing left is the slipper that she lost.
Fortunately it did not hit anything hard on the ground or it would have just been a pile of glass shards.
But he has a slipper.
He makes the rounds of every household in the country.
When they get to where our heroine lives the the bad women try on the slipper.
Of course it does not fit.
But it fits on our heroine who is then understood to be the woman that the prince danced with at the ball.
I probably would not really do it.
But if i was making one for someone else i would open the cabinet.
The one that opens out.
I would find the loaf of seeded rye bread.
So i would get that out.
I would pull out two slices of bread and put them on a plate.
Then i would open the refrigerator and get out a jar of jelly.
I guess i would get peanut butter out of there too.
But i am not sure since i do not know that if it is kept in the refrigerator or not.
But once i had these two things i would open the drawer get out a knife.
I would open the jar.
I would take the knife and get out a dollop of jelly and slather it on one piece of bread.
Then i would lick off the knife.
I would open the jar of peanut butter.
I would stick it in there.
Although going back a bit i would have likely would have toasted both the pieces of bread first so that they would not fall apart when doing the slathering.
Then i would put the two halves together and possibly cut them both in half and then deliver them to the person who asked for the sandwich since it is not a sandwich i would likely have made for myself.
Huh oh there is so many different adventures.
A lot of it has to do with boats and airplanes and cars and going to other countries and building things and going on trips for work.
But what would i consider important?
Well the month of february is broken into three ten day shifts where people would meet at the boat.
A few people were there for the whole month because they were retired and had enough time and money to do it.
We met the boat at the paradise atlantis paradise island resort in in nassau in the bahamas.
I mean by the time our our time was over we were back in fort lauderdale where the boat had been rented.
We did a lot of snorkeling.
So as you are sailing to the next place.
We do not always know where we are going to drop anchor and hang out for the night.
Sometimes it is just some totally uninhabited area or sometimes near an island where we could go to shore and and explore the shore and go to a restaurant.
There was a catamaran which is like two sailboats stuck together with a big cabin in between.
Then we would got into some storms at night where we were just bouncing around like crazy all night.
"We ate a lot drank a lot and snorkeled a lot got a lot of great underwater pictures , barracudas and things."
This is the guy who we would all met at our sailing club because when he was living in bloomington working on a journalism degree.
Then he move back to florida and he arranged us renting the boat for that month.
He would grown up in florida and the bahamas and knew the area pretty well but was also a real character.
You never know what to expect from him.
But oh and he was also about six two with you know scandinavian looking with blonde hair and blue eyes except his hair was in dreadlocks.
Also had some history of of smuggling people and smoke and booze and stuff from the bahamas florida.
But the by far the most bizarre thing happened on the very last morning of the trip because me and captain robbie and a couple of the other younger people were up probably til oh after midnight doing our best to finish off all the different kinds of rums we had on board.
Although there was no way.
We got back we had way too much food and booze.
But i probably went to sleep at one and then woke up at about five and went up to the top of the boat.
Then there is this dining room cabin area and the big outside area.
Then you will go up this spiral staircase up to the very top where the wheel is and the controls for the sails although there was not much wind.
We are going to cross the gulf stream.
So we were just motoring across.
But i got up there.
The two people that were there left and went to sleep.
The other person never woke up.
So i just up there just motoring across the gulf stream.
So the current was coming in a way was not much waves or wind really.
So the full moon was setting in the direction we were going.
So we were going east to west.
The full moon was just slowly setting into the water.
Gradually there started to be land showing.
So the moon was setting.
Then the sun started coming up.
When the sun came up it only lit up the tops of the buildings along that whole miles and miles of development on on fort lauderdale area.
So because of the curvature of the earth the the tops of the buildings are slowly being lit up golden light of the morning sun.
The buildings were getting bigger.
They are getting more of them.
Pretty soon everything you could see on the shore was was buildings.
I thought i was looking around for commercial shipping and things like that.
But i suddenly heard this noise like a horn.
I am looking around.
They asked me to stop and permission to board.
Or i do not know if it was permission exactly.
So i stopped the boat.
Of course there is no brakes or anything.
But i stopped the boat.
They come came on board and were looking up at me and started asking questions which i was answering.
Then by this time people heard and were getting up.
So people were were starting to show up on deck.
So he starts asking for the captain.
And then one of coast guard guys just starts looking around on the boat and just opening hatches looking around and looking into one cabin where somebody had not come out yet.
Walking in places just making sure we are not smuggling large amounts of anything.
One of these younger people that was friends of robbie was on deck and saw there was a joint on deck.
He just stood on it.
He never moved all the rest of the time they were there.
I never came down because you cannot have nobody on the bridge of the boat.
So so i never got out my passport.
But everybody else showed the passports.
And then they told us we should.
Well of course we were going to check in at customs when we get to fort lauderdale.
But and some captain said.
After you know ten minutes they left.
We continued on to fort lauderdale and went back to where we would rented the boat and got out all the incredible amount of way too much food and booze and wine and beer and anything else we had.
Then we all went back by car back to the airport and flew home.
We have still never checked in with us customs.
Next time i went anywhere i think.
What happens when i go through customs?
Are they going to still think i am in the bahamas?
There is johnny practicing soccer badly and kicks the ball.
It goes through a window and breaks it.
But he is got the ball now.
So or carpenter to replace the window bebecause that would be important.
Yeah i remember that one also.
Mom says.
The kid says.
No i do not need an umbrella.
Kid goes outside.
It is raining.
The kid is annoyed.
Mom is annoyed.
Kid goes back out with umbrella to protect from further rain although their feet are kind of wet.
Yes i remember that story.
The same story as last week or should i make up a different one?
Gosh trying to think of something odd like the the girl threw the cat into the tree.
So i guess story would be the cat climbed into the tree and really was not having any problems.
But the girl was really concerned that the cat is trapped in the tree and will wind up being a cat skeleton up there in a few days.
So she got her dad.
Her dad climbed up on the tree and could not really quite get out as far as the cat.
Meanwhile the dog knocked over the ladder the dad used to climb up the tree and is kind of angry with dad.
Somebody used the cellphone and called the fire department because somehow the fire department knows about it.
They are coming with hopefully a longer ladder to rescue the cat and the dog from the tree.
The bird is laughing.
I saw a couple of things i did not see last time.
Once upon a time an evil stepmother with evil daughters is presented with a beautiful nice daughter by a gentleman with a really bizarre looking tie.
The evil stepmother has a nasty cat.
The nice stepdaughter has a goofy but friendly dog.
Soon the king tells his son the prince that he has to have a bride to be a princess because that is the way it works in in evil monarchies.
The king is so annoying that the prince will probably kick him out of the house or he will become king.
He has to have a princess who will become queen.
So the declaration is made throughout the land.
Cinderella the nice stepchild finds a book in a chest in the attic which has absolutely nothing to do with the story.
But she also finds a dress that would be great to wear.
She puts on the dress.
Her evil stepsisters laugh at her because she is not going to go ball because she is nobody.
I think i have missed a couple pages with odd looking animals.
Cinderella is sad she cannot go to the ball.
But the fairy godmother appears.
Fairy godmother presents her with a carriage with goofy looking horses.
That is a pretty goofy looking carriage too and helps her get dressed.
She goes to the ball.
At the ball the prince is dancing with all the eligible women at the ball.
Eligibility includes being between sixteen and twenty years old being high class and having the right creed religion race and financial status.
When he dances with cinderella she is wonderful.
Somehow she knows how to do these dances.
He likes dancing with her.
But suddenly she realizes it is almost midnight.
She hasta go or her weird looking carriage will turn into a pumpkin.
Pumpkins do not travel on old unpaved roads very well at all.
So she gets going.
Pretty soon it does happen.
The carriage turns into a pumpkin.
The horses sit on their butts and will not go any further.
But somehow she does manage to make it home.
The very next day the prince is very agitated because he he only knows who his favorite of the eligible women are because of the glass slipper she left.
He is carrying the glass slipper to the household of each eligible woman.
When he gets to the household of the evil stepmother the evil stepsisters all think that it has to be one of them.
Someone actually tries to break the glass slipper to keep the prince from finding out who the woman really is.
But he the slipper does not break.
He finds that it fits cinderella perfectly.
She gets to leave the house of the evil stepmother and go live with the price and marry the prince to promote the evil monarchy into the future.
They they kill the evil king.
And the prince becomes king.
Then she becomes queen.
Ah i did that one before also.
But i think i forgot a couple of things.
If i was doing it today i would walk fifty feet south and then twenty feet east up three stairs to the kitchen.
Once in the kitchen i would open the refrigerator.
I would take out the bag which has the bread that i made a couple days ago in the bread machine.
I would take out that bag.
Then i would put the knife back in the cabinet.
I would take the two slices of bread put them in the toaster and push down the toaster.
"Then i would hold the bag at one end and spin it a few times , fold it under and open the refrigerator and put the bread back in the refrigerator."
While the refrigerator is open i would find a jar of jelly and put it on the counter and close the door.
But it actually there is not any except for what we use for the mouse traps under the house.
I would get the peanut butter and get a knife out of the drawer and spread the peanut butter on one of the slices of toast after it came out of the toaster.
What was i supposed to do?
When when was i supposed to do that?
Then i would lick off the knife.
Then i would stick the knife in the jelly and spread the jelly on the other piece of bread which is now toast and assemble the two slathered pieces of toast still on the cutting board.
That would be it except for drinks and chips and black garlic and the newspaper and the reading glasses.
Well when i was young i should know but i was about eight.
Back in those days you could walk the neighborhood.
She lived a pretty good ways.
I was walking behind her.
Then she decided it would get us to her house faster if i rode on the back of the seat with her.
So i hopped on the seat.
She started pedaling.
But my heel got caught in the spoke of the wheel as the wheel was spinning and almost cut my heel off.
So she rode ahead to her house.
As she had gone on to her house.
All the cars that were passing thought i was crying bebecause she had stolen my bike.
So nobody stopped to help me but finally got to her house.
So we called my mom.
They came and picked me up and took me to the hospital.
In the waiting room a man came up to me to show me that his head had a fishing hook in it and that mine was worse than his.
But i remember this old man with the fishing hook hanging out of his head.
So i got stitched up.
Looks like there is a little boy who is just hanging out by himself playing soccer when that ball accidentally goes through the middle of that window while the guy is sitting there watching tv probably.
He looks a little shocked.
He takes the soccer ball and keeps it.
I am going to make this up as i go.
It looks to me like mom is offering an umbrella.
His hand is saying.
That looks like a goodbye sign of.
You keep the umbrella.
I am going out the door.
It does start raining.
He does look a little distraught there.
He is getting wet.
I think he is madder there that mom was right.
Next time he goes out the door he takes the umbrella.
Lesson learned.
Well it looks to me like this little girl's cat climbed up a tree and got stuck there or just wanted to hang out there.
I would say the next thing that happened was dad tried to get up the tree to rescue the cat.
By the looks of his face he looks stuck as well.
The dog does not seem too pleased that he is up the tree.
It looks like someone hadta call the fire department to get the ladder to get the cat and dad down.
You have stepmother with her two girls and then cinderella and her father.
I guess something happened to him.
That one i do not remember.
Let us see.
Oh cinderella spends a lot of time by herself.
So is cinderella assuming that she is going to go.
The cinderella i guess then pulled out the trunk and found a book and made a dress.
The stepsisters ripped it all up.
Let us see.
Then the fairy godmother gets in there and whips her up a dress with her magic wand and then reminds her that she hasta be home by midnight.
Let us see.
She got to having a good time dancing at that ball and forgot about the midnight.
Running down the steps she lost one of the glass slippers.
She got home and saw her one glass slipper.
Prince was pretty upset that his lover his pride and joy had disappeared.
So he did find the glass slipper on the stair.
He had his guys go throughout the kingdom to see who this little slipper fit.
I remember in the movie the stepsisters tried to put that on and even were cutting off their toes to make it fit.
The little mice let her out of the room because when they came they did not want cinderella slipping out.
She lived happily ever after with her little mice.
First i would probably go to the store and buy peanut butter and jelly because i do not keep that here nor do i usually keep bread.
"So i would go to the store , buy all of those ingredients probably a bag of potato chips too because i do like to put potato chips into my peanut butter and jelly."
So then i would take out probably a paper plate and put two slices of bread.
I do like my peanut butter first.
So i would pull out a knife.
I would spread the peanut butter on my left side of the bread.
Then i would get my strawberry jam bebecause i am not a fond of grape jelly.
So i would get my strawberry.
I would put it on the right side.
Then i would open my bag of chips.
I would insert some chips into the middle as well as put some on the side of the plate.
I was going to say bebecause i am going to try not to tell you the same story.
Why did not i tell her that?
She had called me not feeling well not feeling well not feeling well.
That went on for a period of four five days or so.
When i called her she was low speaking and what i would consider lethargic.
So i told her i needed her to listen to me.
I needed her to call firstnamem and tell him that she needed to go to the e r that she was dehydrated.
She needed to get intravenous.
Then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth.
If that did not make her feel better.
Well she did get the bone broth and it did not.
Firstnamem did take her to the e r.
They did release her.
It was not long after that iu then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder.
She called me crying.
Then there is nothing like the helpless feeling of the parent when they know you know that they need you.
So it was the decision whether to hop a plane that night.
I i decided not to.
It was firstnamej bebecause firstnamej drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day.
He admitted her into the hospital for that night.
The surgery was the following night.
I did go home the first night.
But i spent the night at the hospital on the second night which i was glad that i did because she was with it but not really with it.
So all turned out good.
But as you know there is still issues.
But all turned out fine.
So i guess that was the most dramatic.
So i have not had anything major since!
The beginning there is a young lad outside playing soccer playing around looks like by himself.
Middle of the story is the soccer ball goes through the window into the family room of a neighbor who was very surprised.
End of the story is once again the neighbor decides to keep the ball and does not go after the little boy.
The beginning of the story the little boy is heading out to school.
I see a backpack on his back.
Mom hands him an umbrella to let him know that it is getting ready to rain.
It will be raining somewhere during the day.
I assume he attended class and was walking home.
Middle of the story is on the way home he gets drenched.
It starts raining.
He is soaking wet.
Moral of the story at the end is he took his umbrella with him next time he went out.
I would say the beginning of the story is the little girl was out riding her bicycle when she happened to notice that her cat had climbed a tree and had gotten stuck.
Middle of the story i would say dad came up and decided he was going to try to help out the kittycat.
He as well got stuck.
End of the story would be the fire department was called to come rescue both of them.
Well cinderella's father who must have been a widower decided to remarry to what became her stepmother who had daughters of her own.
They made her become their servant and serve them food and tea and take care of them.
She had to beat the tapestries.
She had to make the meals.
She had to do everything for them.
She knew that that palace was nearby.
That she thought she was going to be invited.
So she pulled out her book of how to make a gown.
She made a beautiful gown for herself of which the sisters were not going to allow her to attend.
They tore up her dress.
So the fairy godmother decided that she would give cinderella an opportunity to attend the ball.
So i believe it was a pumpkin that turned to the coach.
I believe that gusgus and friends became the horses.
She took the carriage.
Oh the fairy godmother gave her a dress as well and did her hair probably her nails and toes too.
So but she told her.
You only have until midnight.
So she attended the ball.
They danced and danced and danced until it got close to midnight.
She realized how dangerously close she was.
She ran down the stairs of the palace and lost one slipper.
She got back.
Everything turned back to normal the pumpkin and the mice.
I think stepmom got suspicious about who that was at the ball that the prince had fallen in love with and locked her in her room.
She got out.
So when the palace guards came a calling she was able to try on the slipper.
They realized that it was her.
I will skip the part about cutting off the toes this time and all this stuff that they did to the stepdaughters.
I would get out my peanut butter.
I would get out my jelly.
Yes it does have to be strawberry jelly.
I would get my knife out of the drawer.
I would spread the peanut butter on one side trying not to tear my bread.
Which i think i said last week.
You have to have one on one side one on the other side.
I would spread my strawberry jelly.
I would spread that on the other side.
I would get my lays potato chips because you cannot do peanut butter and jelly without lays potato chips.
I would pour some on the plate.
I would put some inside the sandwich.
I would put one slice of bread on the other slice of bread.
I would cut the sandwich into halves and enjoy.
Well i do not know if i should embarrass my daughter.
But my wife and i have been married forty eight years.
We when we first got married we wanted to have children but never worked.
We finally just gave up.
After seventeen years of marriage we had firstnameb.
She all of a sudden woke up pregnant one day.
You know we were middle aged by then.
You know for having babies that was old.
For old people set in their ways that was interesting.
So but you know having her and watching her grow and doing the things that she does or did was just absolutely fascinating.
I to this day it is just you know it is the best thing that is ever happened to me.
Do not tell her i said that.
Young boy playing soccer out in the yard makes an errant boot.
The boot goes through the window.
Ball hits the window.
Hits a lamp as the man's sitting there probably watching tv.
The man is now up looking outside to see where the damage came from.
A lesson learned.
Mom is telling the young man to better take the umbrella.
It is going to rain.
He goes.
He gets outside.
Sure enough it rains.
He gets poured.
He comes back.
He finally learns his lesson takes the umbrella.
Well i think in the beginning a young lady has lost her kitty cat.
Kitty cat climbs the tree.
Probably her dad tried to be the the savior here in the rescue.
He climbed the tree.
The cat moved out to the small limb.
Little girl's hoping he falls.
The dad's caught in the tree.
Apparently someone has called the fire department.
Because the ladder he used to get in the tree has fallen.
The dog is barking at him.
Two firemen are coming fast to see if they cannot save both the cat and the guy.
I have not done it in awhile.
As i remember the story cinderella came to live with the the mean old lady and her two daughters.
She she became the housemaid if you will.
Because they for whatever reason they did not want her around.
She cleaned the house and did all the stuff.
One day found out about a ball that was happening and wished that she could go.
She finally did get to go.
Her fairy godmother came by tapped her on the head.
She turned her into a little princess.
"She went ball , met the the prince , realized that she was going to turn back at midnight."
"So she ran out , dropped her slipper."
But she dropped her slipper.
He sent people out to find her.
They found her.
He tried on the shoe.
First the the bad sisters wanted the shoe.
She tried it on.
It fit.
He fell in love.
They lived happily ever after.
How i would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well first of all i have to get the bread out.
The bread has to be sourdough bread.
Creamy or nut it does not matter.
Then it has to be smucker's grape jelly.
So you take the peanut butter.
Well i had a happy moment last week.
I just got back my book.
I wrote another book.
It came back last week.
Firstnameb's read it.
But she has not seen the book.
She only read the copy.
So i will be sending her a book.
If you would like i will send you one too.
She keeps telling me it is.
I write about me.
I said.
I do not see that.
Yeah you will have to ask her about that.
But that that is always a happy time when that happens.
A little boy's out playing soccer kicking the ball around and unfortunately kicks it a little bit errant and too hard.
It goes through either his dad or the neighbor's window.
Window pops open.
The dad's sitting there.
The ball comes through the window knocks over lamp breaks it.
Dad's picked the ball up looking out the window to see if he can find out how it got through.
It is going to be raining out today.
You oughta take an umbrella.
The little boy goes.
No i do not think so.
He leaves.
Sure enough it rains.
He gets poured.
He comes back and yells at his mom but realizes it is really his fault.
So next time he takes an umbrella.
Well it seems to be a nice sunny day.
Apparently little molly's kitty cat has climbed the tree.
Dad's trying to help out.
He is climbed the tree to get the kitty cat but cannot get beyond the first branch.
So someone along the line has called the fire department.
The fire department's coming to rescue dad.
He is just screaming.
Looks like dad got up there with a ladder.
But the ladder fell over.
But he is just having a good day.
You know i do not like this story.
I asked firstnameb last time i said.
I had to tell the story of cinderella.
I said.
But i do not think i ever read it to you.
She goes.
I do not think so.
She instantly became their servant girl i would assume.
She put up with that having to do all the errands and all the dirty work while the two sisters enjoyed life.
Then one day she found out that there is going to be a ball.
She decided that she would try to go.
And her mean aunt told her no.
But anyway she went.
She she met her fairy godmother who took her under her wing and tapped her on the head with a wand.
She turned into a beautiful young princess and went to the ball or met the prince.
Realized that she had to be out by midnight or she would turn into a pumpkin.
On the way out of the castle she dropped her glass slipper.
All the the mean lady and her daughters tried on the shoe.
She lived happily ever after.
Oh i like that one too.
But this will be the same as last time because i make it the same way.
But i always like to make it with.
My daughter and i have this thing about sourdough bread.
We love it.
So we get sourdough bread.
Matter of fact we had some last night.
It is got to be jif peanut butter jif.
We always make it with jif peanut butter.
We will use i say smuckers all the time.
But welch's or smuckers grape jelly has to be grape jelly.
My dog and i usually share that.
Approximately twenty two years ago my oldest brother firstnamee collapsed in a stairwell.
Turned out he had total renal failure.
We decided to get tested to see if we could donate a kidney.
I already knew that i was going to be a perfect match.
I actually knew that.
The body has six blood antigens.
Firstnamee and i both are missing one.
So the doctor said that not only did we match better than twins the kidneys should last at least twenty years.
So and he is doing great.
I do not get to see him as much as i want to bebecause he is in northern virginia.
But he is doing well.
So yeah that is kind of a big thing in my life that you know that he pees nicely because of his sister.
Now you can unmute yourself.
One day a boy was walking along playing with his soccer ball.
He accidentally hit it right into a man's living room window and promptly actually hit the man as well.
So the man got up to find out who in the world put a soccer ball through his window.
Let us see.
A boy wanted to go for a walk.
He asked his mom for permission.
She goes.
Yes but you hafta go out with your umbrella.
But then he forgot his umbrella.
So he had to go back to the house and get the umbrella which his mom was not happy with because he got drenched.
So he got the umbrella and went back out for his walk.
One day a man and his daughter were walking their dog.
The dog got aggressive and decided to want to bite the dad.
So he ran up a tree.
The same time the cat also ran up the tree to help the dad.
That did not work out.
So then they hadta call the fire department to try to get everyone out of the tree safely.
Cinderella was adopted by her stepmom and her stepsisters who were very spoiled brats.
She made cinderella do all kind of chores.
But cinderella also fell in love with the animals that were there in the house.
They befriended her.
She looked longingly out of her window to the castle and thought how cool it would be to one day go there which those sisters thought was absolutely absurd that she would ever go to the castle.
One day they found out that there was going to be a ball at the castle.
So the stepsisters had their dresses made.
But cinderella could not go because she she was a maid.
She did not have a dress.
So her fairy godmother decided that cinderella needed to go to the castle and be happy.
"So she waved her wand , made her a dress."
She rode into the castle with a beautiful dress and glass slippers and saw the prince.
They fell in love almost immediately after they were dancing.
But then the clock struck midnight.
She had to go because she was about to be changed back into a maid.
So as she was running she lost her slipper which the prince actually found.
He wanted to find out who this belonged to because that was going to be his wife.
So actually his servant came out and tried all the shoes first of all the sisters.
Of course it did not fit because they had big fat fucking feet.
So then they tried on cinderella.
Of course it fit perfectly.
So they were reunited with each other.
They lived happily ever after.
Oh i had not made one of those in a long time!
You get out two slices of bread.
You get the knife out.
You hafta put the jelly on first because the jelly soaks the knife.
It will get in the peanut butter.
Then you put the peanut butter on.
Let us see.
Let us see.
I had a fulltime job.
So i decided to take a parttime job.
My brother used to work at a bowling center.
Actually he still does.
He is the one i did the kidney with.
He goes.
So i did that for maybe a couple months.
This guy came in.
Firstnamee hired him to be the the busboy you know clean the tables and stuff.
So and we all became good friends.
Well fast forward that we have now been married thirty five years.
So my my oldest brother hired my husband to be.
Let us see.
One day a boy went for a walk.
He had his soccer ball with him.
So he likes to practice.
So he was decided he is just going to go and kick this ball.
Well that wadn a good idea because when he kicked he hit a house through the window.
So unfortunately there was someone right there in the chair who also saw the whole thing.
So he jumped up real quick the guy in the house and said.
Who did that?
But but the boy was gone.
One day a little boy wanted to take a walk.
It was raining.
His mother said.
But you cannot go out unless you have an umbrella because you will get wet.
I do not really want to.
She goes.
But you are going to have to if you want to go out.
I think i am just going to go out anyways.
She did not like that too much.
So he went out in the rain.
You know what?
He did not like it so much because it was pouring.
He got drenched.
So he went back in the house.
So if you want to go back in the rain and walk that is fine.
But you have to take an umbrella this time.
He goes.
He walked out with his umbrella and had a great walk in the rain.
One day a father daughter they were taking a walk with their cat.
While they were walking a dog started chasing the cat.
The cat got really scared.
So the cat ran up a tree.
Well then the dad got worried.
So he was trying to get the cat.
He actually got up there.
Then he got stuck.
So she is trying to get the cat to come down by jumping in her arms.
But that did not work either.
But thank goodness someone saw all this and called the fire department who helped get everyone out of the tree.
Once there was this beautiful girl who unfortunately her mother died.
So she ended up living with her stepmother and her three sisters.
But the sisters were spoiled brats.
She ended up making poor cinderella a slave in her own home.
She had to do all the chores.
Well as cinderella grew up she fantasized about one day maybe actually visiting the castle that she was able to see from her bedroom window.
That will never happen.
They had some animals on the farm where she lived.
"She befriended them , became just such best friends."
One day the king decided that his son needed to find a wife.
But she did not have anything to wear.
So her fairy godmother created this beautiful dress for her.
She put it on.
So she rode to the castle in this beautiful carriage.
They she ended up dancing with the prince.
They fell in love.
But unfortunately it turned midnight.
Everything turned back to normal at midnight.
So she hadta run off before he could see her change back to an old maiden.
But she lost her glass slipper on the way.
He found it.
So once again he decreed that every female is going to try this this slipper on to find his his soon to be wife.
Well so the knight came to the stepmother's house.
Those three girls try to get their big feet into the slipper.
And he said.
They said.
They lied.
He actually saw cinderella.
He goes.
No she needs to try it on too.
So she tried it on.
It fit perfectly.
So the prince found his wife to be.
They got married and lived happily ever after.
You will need two slices of bread.
You will need some peanut butter and some jelly.
"You are going to open up the the two sandwiches , lay them down."
One side you are going to put the peanut butter.
On the other side you are going to put the jelly.
Then you are going to put them back together.
You may opt to take the crust off if you want.
I like the crust.
I get so longwinded.
I am trying to think of something happy now.
Okay i will tell you about a girls' weekend.
Okay so i have a good friend.
We started way back.
We have lived all over the country.
Our lives have kind of paralleled each other until when i was in massachusetts.
So anyway we would meet once a year.
Well we were always married when we knew each other.
Now we have kids.
Kids they were middle school age when we started these girls' weekends.
It became an annual thing.
Typically we went to philadelphia.
We we would drive or fly into philadelphia.
We met there or sometimes baltimore.
They would always start the first night we would be like up late.
Which every time we say we are not going to do it bebecause it always killed our first full day together.
We would just drag the hotel chairs in front of a window and wine.
We would pack cheese and crackers and grapes.
Whoever drove brought you know packed whatever they could.
The other person would pick up a bottle of wine from the liquor store on the way in.
Anyway we would sit the evening and catch up.
Then the next day we would get up and have a delicious breakfast out or just a cup of coffee.
Then we would go.
In philadelphia there was this first time which then became a tradition we stumbled upon this store.
We could not figure out the lighting was a little weird.
Anyway it turned out to be a great consignment shop.
I mean like just unbelievable clothes.
We would spend hours in there.
We would try on.
We got bags.
Then we would bring those back to the hotel.
Then we would go out for our happy hour somewhere.
Then we would go out for dinner.
Then sometimes on some of the weekends we would do.
So we would just do like a treatment like a facial somewhere.
The older we got and the more entitled and more disgruntled we became.
So we would go for a facial or something.
Then on sunday we would always go out for our breakfast again.
Then whoever had the car would drive the other one to the airport.
Do you have to tell the story?
Bebecause i have been trying to go in order of the pictures?
Or you can take the pictures any way you want in your story?
Bebecause it was not til i got to the end i was like.
Okay so in box one there is a boy kicking a soccer ball.
He is having a great time.
Then unfortunately he kicks it too high and or far.
It goes smashing through a window in box two.
In box three you get to see what is on the other side of the window.
There is a gentleman in his seat nice comfy chair.
This ball comes smashing through his window and looks like it may land in his lap.
Then in box four he has the ball in his hand.
He is looking out the window to hopefully just return the ball and not yell at that poor boy for the accident.
So i am going to say that this is a mother and her son.
She is telling him in the first box.
Why i am giving you the umbrella because it is going to probably rain today.
In the second box he is he is taking the umbrella from her hand.
He says thank you.
Then in the third box the rain starts.
I am assuming he he he has not started to use yet.
He just did not think he was going to get very wet.
Then the rain really starts coming down in box four.
He is getting very wet.
There are now puddles by his little feet.
When he gets home and his mom sees him he is not happy bebecause he is wet.
She is very disappointed that he has not used the umbrella.
In the fifth box he starts thinking about.
If only i had had that umbrella i would not be wet.
I would not have puddles on my shoes.
So i see that a man has climbed up in the tree to rescue the cat.
Once he got up there he or the dog knocked down the ladder.
She is trying to call the cat.
So she is trying to call the cat down.
The man is going to try to inch out and get the cat.
In the meantime somebody wisely called the fire department because even if he gets the cat he cannot get down from the tree bebecause his ladder's down.
So the firemen are racing over to help him.
"Looking by his sad frustrated , why did i even attempt this face , he the firemen are going to rescue him and the cat."
The dog eagerly is awaiting the cat.
She i i guess her father got remarried to a woman who became her stepmother.
This woman had two daughters of her own.
They quickly moved into cinderella's house and overtook the house.
I do forget if what happened to the dad.
But he went off.
The stepmother and the stepsisters used cinderella as a maid.
They renamed her to cinderella because of cinders and all the cleaning.
They told her how she was not pretty.
The region decides the prince is going to have a ball.
The two sisters come home and the mom.
They are very excited because there is going to be a ball.
All the young women of the land are invited.
The two sisters start planning their outfits.
The mother's involved in it.
All assuming that cinderella would never even go because she is ugly and dirty.
The prince would never want to see her.
So the night comes.
The two sisters get themselves all beautiful.
Off they go to the ball.
I think the mother may have gone as well.
She is left at home.
She is sitting out in the garden.
Her fairy godmother appears.
The fairy godmother has a chitchat with her and finds out she really does want to go.
So the fairy godmother uses her wonderful magic wand and then uses the help of the tiny little mice.
The mice are poof become the chariot attendants.
So the the fairy godmother gets her all beautiful in a dress.
She takes a pumpkin va va va voom.
The pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot.
The mice become the chariot people.
They open the doors.
They drive her off to the ball.
She has a lovely night.
As she gets into the pumpkin chariot which is now beautiful the fairy godmother says.
But you must he home by midnight bebecause all this is going to disappear the magic at midnight.
So she goes off.
She goes to the ball.
The prince is dancing with everybody.
Of course he sees cinderella who is by far the most beautiful in the room.
He asks her to dance.
They have many lovely dances.
Then all of a sudden she tunes into what time it is somehow.
She says.
I must leave.
He says.
No i really must go.
She starts to run off because it is almost about to strike midnight.
She is running down the steps of the palace.
She just gets into her pumpkin chariot.
She leaves.
As she is running she leaves a beautiful pump on the steps.
She as she goes the chariot turns back into a pumpkin.
She manages to get home in time before the stepsisters.
They come home and say what a wonderful time.
They kind of tease her for being stuck at home and ask her what she did.
They dream about what a wonderful time.
Everybody learns the following morning that whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind.
He is going throughout the lands to find whose foot fits this slipper.
So eventually they get to cinderella's home.
The two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it.
Of course it does not fit.
Cinderella wants to try it.
They think it is ridiculous because she was not really supposed to be there.
Somehow she sweet talks and she gets to try the slipper on.
Or maybe the prince's helper says.
No let her try.
Her foot fits.
"Voila she is the princess , the beautiful woman that was dancing with the prince."
He comes.
He meets cinderella.
As soon as her eyes and face he knows it is really cinderella.
He takes her away.
He makes her his wife.
They live happily ever after.
I do not know what ever happened to the father or the stepmother or the sisters.
Okay til recently i never knew people did this other ways.
I am of the belief that you take two pieces of bread the peanut butter jar the jelly jar.
You spread the peanut butter all over one side.
Then you put the jelly on top of the peanut butter.
Then you put the sandwich.
You cut in half.
I recently just heard.
A thin layer on both sides of the bread keeps the bread from getting soggy.
Then you put the jelly.
So both sides have peanut butter.
Any i think of everything that is so important in my life firstnamea.
Let us see.
I am trying to think of something happy upbeat.
So we moved out to michigan as a very young couple.
Shortly afterwards i found out i was pregnant with our first child.
I felt so healthy for nine months.
I did have two fears health health fears.
But fortunately neither of those came true.
I went to work every day.
The baby was not born.
We did not find out the sex.
I wanted to be totally surprised.
I love surprises.
So on january eighteenth i had still not had the baby and had a a scheduled checkup with the ob doctor and assumed it would be my last visit.
My husband met me because first child.
So anyway the whole time i am carrying this baby which by the way first baby.
This baby barely moved.
Comparatively to the second nothing to i thought it was fine because what did i know?
Every time i would push my stomach i would say oh.
She bebecause my mother had three girls.
My other sister had three girls.
My other sister had a girl.
So i would say.
Oh she is going to have a really firm butt.
So last visit last checkup he does an internal.
Oh why do not we go across the hall.
I want to do a a scan.
Or i do not know what they called it at the time.
He says yep.
He goes.
Just what i thought.
You know bebecause it was just such an exciting time.
He goes.
So you are going to have a csection.
That was one of my two secret secret fears of having a baby.
You can flip this baby.
You can do this.
You can do that.
We really do not know why the baby did not drop.
I i guess that was another thing.
Image he could not see the cord.
Or he saw a little bit.
We do not really know how long the cord is.
He gave me every reason this baby was not going to be flipped.
So you know there is lots of things out there firstnamea.
I should look to see if i am correct in my memory.
There was no internet but folklore.
Upside down leaning on a ironing board.
Monday was scheduled for my csection.
That was the only day i missed at work.
I worked a full day on thursday.
The baby was scheduled to be born on monday.
Sunday night i went to bed.
My water broke.
I was so excited because then i felt a little bit more like the baby's truly ready.
So i did not wake up my husband.
I decided to go get my bag.
I got everything ready by the door before i woke him up.
I showered.
I shaved my legs.
Now the contractions are getting worse.
I could not find the list of people he had to call.
I spent way too much time looking for the list.
"I woke him up , called the doctor."
He hops in the shower bebecause we are both wackadoodles.
We both take a shower.
When i told the doctor you know the timing of everything he was like.
You need to get to the hospital now.
Well i need to find the list.
No firstnameb you need to get to the hospital now.
So if you did not have the phone numbers you know you had ten memorized in your head.
We were not putting down the garage door at night because we were having exceptionally bitter cold.
Off we go to the hospital.
My husband almost missed the exit.
We went from the left lane to the exit.
He dropped me off at the curbside.
There was a policeman waiting with a wheelchair which freaked me out even more.
Off we go.
Oh you are scheduled.
No doctor lastnameg promised me one more sonogram sonogram to to just make sure bebecause maybe she had flipped.
The nurses kind of did an eye roll.
But they humored me.
She turns out she was a footling breech.
It turns out she was a she.
So the csection started.
They had to do a bunch of different stuff.
My husband came with me.
They said.
Do you want to watch?
They shamed me.
You do not want to see your baby born?
I said.
All i want to see is the baby at the moment.
That is what they did.
My second one was born in ninety three.
I begged for a vbac.
I was probably one of the last vbacs ever done.
He was born fine.
Can i ask a question again?
I i thought about this as i looked at that rainy boy picture.
Am i supposed to tell the story.
I think i asked this last time.
The these boxes or rectangles are numbered.
Is that how i should be proceeding with beginning middle end one through four?
Okay so there is a adolescent boy.
He is practicing his soccer skills.
He is kicking them.
The better he does with his skills the more enthusiastically he kicks until eventually he kicks the ball.
It smashes through a window.
On the other side the window there is a adult man sitting there in his chair.
That ball when it comes through the window knocks the lamp over.
He stands up.
He has the ball.
He looks out the window.
He says.
He then goes outside and returns the ball.
So here we have a mom and her little boy.
The mom is telling him that he really needs to take an umbrella today because it is going to rain.
So he thinks about it.
He smiles at her.
He takes the umbrella from her.
But he does not have it quite handy.
So the rain comes down on him.
He is thinking.
Then it really starts to rain.
Now he is getting wet.
He goes home.
What were you thinking?
I gave you the umbrella.
Why did not you use it?
He tells her that on the way out that morning he left it in the garage.
So then in the last picture it shows him that the next time it is raining out he remembers or agrees to use the umbrella.
He walks happily in the rain without getting wet.
So there was a little girl.
She had a cat.
Her cat ran away.
She was looking all over the neighborhood.
She rode her tricycle around looking for the cat.
She finally spotted the cat up in a tree.
Then she found an adult to help her.
He came running over.
He was walking by with his dog.
He came over to help her.
Then once he got up in the tree he realized that the branch could not support him.
He wanted to get the cat.
But he thought the branch may collapse.
Meantime someone from the neighborhood called the fire department because they could see that this branch was not going to support this man.
He would get stuck.
So they called the fire department.
The fire department came.
The firemen were came over.
They brought a ladder to help the man first get the man outta the tree.
"Then the other one could climb up the ladder , get the cat and return it to the little girl."
Okay so the story of cinderella is it is a young woman who lives with her dad.
He meets a woman.
She has two daughters.
He brings this woman and her daughters over to meet cinderella.
I think they get married.
I think he quickly sadly dies.
So cinderella is now left in the home with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who really were never so great to her anyway.
But now that her dad is gone she is treated very terribly.
She is treated like the maid the slave.
They call her cinderella bebecause they make her you know do clean out the chimney.
She has dirt that look like cinders on her face.
So anyway in this land where they live there is a kingdom with a king and a prince.
The castle makes a declaration.
They are going to have a ball.
All the young women in the land are invited to come meet the eligible prince.
Then she quickly finds out from her stepsisters and her stepmother that there is absolutely no way that she is going.
Plus i think the stepsisters really could always tell she was much more beautiful than they were.
They did not want the competition at the ball.
So the night of the ball comes.
They lock her in somewhere.
I think the oldsters.
They locked her in somewhere.
Off they went.
She is crying or sitting there so sad.
She had such a great life.
She is been terrible since he died.
Her fairy godmother appears.
She shares all that has happened and not happening with the fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother says.
Cinderella you are going to go to the ball.
She gets the help of the mice.
She does all sorts of bippidy boom magic on little cinderella.
"She her hair's done, her makeup, her jewelry, a beautiful gown."
She takes a pumpkin from the outside.
She makes it a beautiful beautiful chariot.
The little mice are you know biddili bop boomed.
They are turned into horsemen.
She says.
You look beautiful.
However all this magic and the spells will expire at midnight.
You must get home by midnight.
Cinderella says.
Off they all go in this beautiful chariot to the ball.
She goes.
The prince finally asks her to dance.
Then they continue dancing throughout the evening.
They are enjoying each other's conversation.
All of a sudden she sees and then starts hearing the clock which is about to strike midnight.
She says.
I have to go.
He says.
She says.
As she is rushing out of the ball and down the palace steps she loses a slipper.
She walks the rest the way home with the mice.
She gets home in time before the stepsisters who then arrive home.
They share with their mom and cinderella what a wonderful time they had.
But they do kind of sorta make reference that the prince did spend most of his time dancing with one beautiful woman.
So next day or two it comes out that that woman that monopolized the prince lost her glass slipper when she was leaving.
He has it.
He is now going around with an assistant.
They are trying the glass slipper on every maiden's foot in the kingdom.
So eventually he comes to their house.
He knocks on the door.
The stepsisters even fight amongst themselves as to who is big foot can try to fit in there.
Of course their feet do not.
Cinderella wants to try the slipper on.
She requests it.
The stepsisters say.
So the prince says.
No no no let us try it.
So she slips her foot into the glass slipper.
It fits perfectly.
The prince is happy bebecause when their eyes meet then they kind of see a familiarity of each other.
The stepsisters flip out.
So cinderella is whisked off to the palace.
She lives happily ever after with the prince who truly loves her.
So the way i make my peanut butter jelly is is i put peanut butter on one slice of bread.
Then i put my jelly on top of the peanut butter because i do not like a lot of jelly.
So i just lightly go over it.
I also like extremely soft bread.
I then take the second slice of bread.
I put it on top.
Then i always slice on a diagonal because i think it makes it look fancier than right across the middle.
Which i cracked up when you showed me the picture earlier of that sandwich bebecause it was sliced on a diagonal.
I thought.
See that is the way they are supposed to be sliced.
Okay so we got married in the summer.
We were married in a church.
Who would not say that?
Ceremony because my husband's father had a little over a year before that been diagnosed with leukemia a rare form of leukemia.
We knew that he was not going to live a lot longer.
But he was undergoing treatments.
So rather than being just the father of the groom he stood by my husband.
You know it was just partly partly it was because of that and partly because my husband and i were so thrilled to be marrying one another we stood at that alter and simply sobbed while we said our vows to one another.
I mean it was just so emotional.
It was just you know as if all the world was gone.
We were zoned in and but knowing how significant of an event it was because it was the last significant big event like that of his dad's life.
One day elliot was playing soccer.
By himself he was practicing his soccer moves.
He kicked the soccer ball accidentally so hard so high that it went right into his neighbor ralph's window.
Broke the window went inside ralph's house knocked over the lamp that ralph was sitting next to.
So ralph got up with the ball.
He walked over to the window.
He looked outside where there he saw elliot.
Elliot had an embarrassed embarrassed look on his face.
His head hung low.
Ralph remembered the time when he was little and he had hit a baseball into his neighbor's yard and how embarrassed he felt.
"So rather than going outside and yelling at elliot , ralph went outside."
He said.
You know what?
I did the same thing one day.
Let us figure out how we can fix it together.
They did.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named ben.
His he was getting ready to go to school.
His mother said.
Ben it is going to rain today.
You need to take the umbrella.
He said.
Nope i do not.
I do not need an umbrella.
She said.
Ben you need to take the umbrella.
He said.
Nope i am going to go without it.
So he started walking to school.
As he walked to school it started raining a little bit.
But he got to school.
But at the end of the day he was walking home.
It had been raining all day long.
It was still raining.
So on his way home he was walking through puddles getting poured on.
By the time he got home he was drenched.
His mother was very unhappy that he had not taken the umbrella.
He said.
I know.
So the next day when he went to school he took the umbrella and arrived at school nice and dry.
Once upon a time there was a little girl who had a cat named spotty.
Spotty one day went outside and climbed the tree which very much upset the little girl who had been riding her tricycle.
So she called her father.
Her father got out the ladder and climbed up to go get spotty the cat.
But the little girl and her father's dog barky came along.
Barky knocked over the ladder.
So then the father was trapped in the tree trying to get spotty.
So the dog was barking so loudly that the.
I do not know.
She saw this happening from the window.
So she called the fire department.
The firefighters came using their ladder.
They got both dad and spotty down from the tree.
Everybody lived happily ever after.
Once upon a time there was a woman who had two daughters.
She married a man who had a daughter of his own.
When they came to live together the two daughters of the woman were very very unkind and and were not happy about having this other girl come live with them.
So in fact they made her do all the work and all of the chores.
They made her do lots and lots of work.
She was very very kind however to the animals because they were really the only friends she had.
Well cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace.
What was happening in the palace at the time was that it was time for the prince to be married.
So his father was saying that that they he needed to decide who he was going to marry.
So they decided to have a ball where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village.
So an invitation went out to cinderella's family.
Her stepmother received the invitation.
Her stepmother told her daughters about it who got very excited.
But they did not really say anything to cinderella.
The daughters started preparing their dresses and getting things ready for the ball.
But they were not going to give a dress to cinderella.
So she went into her treasure chest.
She opened up a book and had some old fabric in it.
She looked at that and and decided to make herself a dress for the ball.
But then when the time came for the sisters to all go to the ball they said.
Oh you need to fix my dress.
You need to fix my dress.
They ripped things from cinderella's dress to use on theirs.
Before long she had nothing to wear to the ball.
They were not going to have her go with them.
She went out into the garden.
There she saw happened to see a pumpkin and and the mice.
Pretty soon a fairy godmother appeared.
The fairy godmother said to cinderella some magical words.
She turned the pumpkin into a carriage.
She turned the mice into horsemen or horses.
She turns cinderella's ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown.
Cinderella went to the ball.
But the fairy godmother said.
You must leave by midnight because then the the coach will become a pumpkin.
Your dress will turn back to rags.
Cinderella walked into the ball.
The prince and she began to dance.
But at midnight the clock struck.
She knew she had to leave.
So she ran out of the castle.
She ran down the steps.
When she did she ran right out of one of her glass slippers.
She ran and ran into the fields until indeed her dress returned to rags.
The coach turned back into a pumpkin.
One of the mice had a key for some.
Oh i know.
Bebecause i guess they locked her up or something.
I cannot remember why what was going on in that picture.
The mice unlocked the key.
Bebecause the prince was coming to to see whose foot fit that glass slipper because he knew that was the woman he wanted to marry.
When he arrived at the house they tried the shoe on the two sisters.
It did not fit.
But cinderella was locked up.
But the mice found the key unlocked cinderella's room.
She tried on the slipper.
It fit.
Then the prince knew that she was the one he wanted to marry.
They married and lived as all fairies tales say happily ever after.
I would get the bread out of the cabinet.
I would get two pieces of bread and put them on a plate.
I would get the peanut butter and the jelly out and put them on the counter.
I would lid to the peanut butter and screw the lid to the jelly.
I would get a knife.
I would dip it in the peanut butter jar then spread the peanut butter on one side of one piece of the bread.
Then i would dip the knife into the jelly jar and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter.
Then i would put the other piece of bread on top of the jelly side.
Then i would screw the lid back onto the peanut butter back onto the jelly.
This time i will tell you about the birth of my first child.
I had the good fortune of having a fairly benign you know easy pregnancy.
Nothing had happened.
Nothing had happened.
I that day was singing in a.
A small chamber group i should say that i was part of at a wedding.
So the chamber group was singing at the wedding.
So i went to the wedding.
We sang.
I did kind of notice that you know i felt a little bit of cramping here and there.
But you know whatever.
It was very unusual to have a chamber group sing at the wedding.
Then i came home.
I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened periodically.
But i really did not think it was happening.
I called my sister who lived.
So she already has three children.
So we are talking on the phone.
As we are talking you know she is asking me all about it.
And and i said something about you know kind of describing.
She was asking.
So i was describing a little bit of what i was experiencing that day.
She said.
Firstnames you are having a baby today.
I said.
No i am not because you know there was not even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and what not.
So i kept saying.
She said.
Yeah you are having a baby today.
So and that was really like late afternoon when that happened.
By about six of the clock i think it was i started feeling more stuff happening.
Still i did not think we needed.
There was any big deal.
I you know it was not enough.
I think we must have arrived at the hospital by by by seven thirtyish.
I think this was my first child.
You get ththem kind of confused.
Anyway he is of course you know like.
Oh my gosh you are going to have a baby right now.
And and so of course i was having contractions in the car.
At one point he was speeding.
And he barely would stop for the lights.
We all continued to laugh because my words were.
I i yelled at him to slow down and said.
I mean i know it sounds ridiculous.
But he and i just always laugh at that still to this day.
It is about me which was a stupid thing to say.
But you know who is rational at that point.
So we got to the hospital.
She was born at about eleven thirty five.
I boy what kind of mom am i?
I did not even remember.
Somewhere after eleven thirty because i remember when she was born then that i was thinking about what date it was.
That somebody had hoped that if i would had it on the fifteenth it would be on their birthday.
I had you know missed that window.
But anyway you know of course that is incredible when you hold your first child in your arms for the first time.
And you know that is not to say it did not hurt ashley.
That is not to say it did not hurt.
But it was a you know a great experience all in all.
And then we had our first baby.
Once there was a boy named sam.
Sam loved to play soccer.
So sam could not play soccer with his soccer team.
The best he could do was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around.
He kicked and kicked and kicked.
Eventually he accidentally kicked his soccer ball so hard that it went right into the window of his neighbor's house.
His neighbor was an adult man named ferdinand.
Ferdinand was sitting in isolation in his home because it was during the corona virus pandemic.
When all of a sudden the soccer ball came through the window knocked over the lamp beside him.
He was rattled.
He hopped up.
He got that soccer ball.
He looked out the window.
Out the window he can see sam.
But he knew he could not go say anything to sam because of the corona virus.
So ferdinand kept the ball in his house.
The next day he called a window repair person to come and patch up the window.
He said to himself.
When this virus is over then i will take the ball back over to sam.
Once there was a boy named bennet.
He lived with his mother.
His mother knew that it was supposed to rain that day.
So she told bennet that he needed to take his umbrella with him to school.
But bennet said.
It is not raining outside.
I do not need an umbrella.
He refused to take the umbrella.
She said.
You are going to need this later on.
But he refused and said goodbye.
Well as he was walking to school sure enough it started to rain.
By the time he got to school he was pretty wet.
He spent the day drying out his shoes in school.
Then he got his chair wet.
But it all dried out eventually.
But by the time he got was ready to come home it was not only raining.
It was pouring.
There were puddles on the sidewalk.
He stepped into all those puddles.
He ran in the rain to get home as fast as he could.
By the time he got home he was drenched.
His mother could not help herself.
She said.
I told you so bennet.
Bennet felt bad about that and knew that his mother was right.
So the next day when it was still raining he took his umbrella to school.
As she was riding her tricycle she.
What happened?
She was riding her tricycle.
But she was chasing after her cat.
Her cat had run out and and run down the street.
But she got off her tricycle because the cat not only had run down the street.
The cat ran up the tree.
Her cat would not come down.
Well pretty soon she called for her dad.
Her dad got out the ladder.
Her dad started climbing up the ladder.
He climbed up the tree trying to get the cat.
But while he was sitting on the tree trying to reach the cat their dog came running out into the yard and knocked the ladder over barking barking barking up the tree at dad.
So then not only could dad not reach the cat but dad could not get down because the dog had knocked over the ladder.
She saw all of this disaster happening.
She called nineoneone.
Before long the firefighters came.
They brought a ladder to the tree.
Hannah's dad climbed down the ladder.
One of the firefighters climbed out onto the branch got the cat climbed down the ladder gave the cat back to hannah.
Everyone went home.
Once upon a time there was a woman who had two daughters.
She met a man who had a daughter of his own.
The two fell in love and got married.
But that meant that they then had a blended family.
Well the two daughters of the woman did not like the daughter of the man.
In fact they made her work in the cinders cleaning up the house cleaning up the ashes and the cinders in the chimney.
They eventually just called her cinderella.
They were unkind and made her serve them.
While she could not befriend the sisters because they would not allow it she did befriend the animals that were around the house.
Well at the that time there was a prince in the kingdom.
The king decided that it was time for that prince to find a bride.
So they decided to host a great ball where all of the women of the kingdom would come and dance with the prince.
He would have his pick to choose from.
Well an invitation went out to all of the young women of the kingdom.
An invitation went to the home of this woman and her two daughters and her stepdaughter.
She read the invitation aloud.
Well cinderella went off to her room.
She opened up her trunk where she had an old dress.
She and her little animal friends found ways to add ribbons and things to the dress to make it presentable for the ball.
Her sisters at the same time were trying to make dresses for themselves.
When they saw the really pretty dress that cinderella had made they ripped off the ribbons.
They ripped off the beads and the necklace that she was wearing.
They put them on their own dresses and ribbons until cinderella was left with nothing presentable to wear to the ball.
The stepsisters said that she was not going to the ball.
Cinderella was left at home.
She was out in the garden crying when all of a sudden her fairy godmother appeared to her.
The fairy godmother waved her magic wand.
She turned the mice into horses.
She turned the pumpkin in the garden into a carriage.
So suddenly cinderella had a way to get to the ball.
But she had no dress.
The fairy godmother waved her magic wand until cinderella's ragged dress turned into a beautiful ball gown.
Off she went.
But before she headed off to the ball the fairy godmother warned her that at midnight she must be out of the castle because her dress would return to rags.
The carriage would return to a pumpkin.
The horses would return mice that they once were.
Cinderella then went off to the ball.
When she arrived all of a sudden the prince saw a completely new person enter.
His eye went directly to cinderella.
He asked her to dance.
They danced and danced.
He danced with no other woman the rest of the night.
The two stepsisters did not even recognize that this was cinderella.
But suddenly the clock struck midnight.
Cinderella gasped as she ran out of the castle.
The prince called for her.
He did not even know her name.
But she ran out of the castle down the steps when suddenly her dress returned to rags.
The the the carriage returned to a pumpkin.
The horses became mice once again.
The only thing she had left was one of the slippers because it had fallen off.
But she picked it up.
Well she went home.
Within a few days the prince said he had to find the princess.
He saw that there was the other slipper glass that was on the step.
He said this was it.
This slipper belonged to that beautiful woman.
If we can only find this woman she would be my bride.
So off they went looking for the woman whose foot would fit into the glass slipper.
They arrived at the house of cinderella's stepmother.
The two stepsisters came out and tried very hard to get their foot into that glass slipper.
But before they did so they locked cinderella into her room.
They figured out a way to get the key.
They unlocked the door so that cinderella could come out of her room.
She came down.
"The prince saw her , noticed her ragged outfit , but said that he was willing to put the slipper onto her foot."
I actually do not think it was the prince.
I actually think it was the princes like assistant but whatever.
He put the slipper onto her foot.
It fit perfectly.
Indeed then suddenly they knew that this was the woman that the prince wanted to marry.
They lived happily ever after.
I would go to the kitchen.
In my house the bread is in the refrigerator so that it stays fresher longer.
So i would open the refrigerator door.
I would pull out the bread and the jelly.
Then i would open the cabinet and pull out the peanut butter.
I would then take two slices of bread out of the bread bag.
Then i would unscrew the jar to the peanut butter.
I would scoop some peanut butter out of the jar and spread it on one of the pieces of bread.
Then i would put the lid back on.
Then i would take the other piece of bread.
Well back in nineteen ninety eight we were living in vermont.
My i was teaching at the local school.
My husband was working remotely for a big scale company that made weighing devices for trucks and railroad tracks and that was his specialty.
So anyway at that point the company offered him the opportunity to go to europe and and work and do his job there.
Because they needed someone to be doing that.
So after a lot of discussion we decided that we would do that.
So we he went over first in nineteen ninety eight.
We sold our house.
The school i was teaching at was partly residential.
So i got a job working in the dorm and living there.
Our son went off to college and our daughter was already already finishing up an advanced degree.
So i lived in vermont for another year.
Then i went over after our daughter got married that june.
After i finished my teaching job i went over to join my husband in switzerland which.
We lived in a little village outside of zrich.
In switzerland you do not have any urban sprawl or anything.
So you have these little villages that are just kind of compact and selfcontained.
Not that they have that much there.
I mean it is really just usually a small store a post office and houses.
So we lived there for a year.
During that time it turned out that they really needed firstnamej to move to france too.
I had lived in france as a student.
So moving to france was of course like a dream come true for me.
So we ended up moving to france.
We lived in a city called lille which is about an hour north of paris.
Just cannot even tell you how much i loved being there.
My husband did too.
Although it got a whole lot better as we were there.
In zrich they speak german but it is swiss german and most people speak english.
So anyway i ended up teaching english.
We had a wonderful time.
Everybody that we knew practically came to visit us.
We did a lot of traveling around europe at the time.
Then we came back in two thousand and three right as the invasion of iraq happened.
I ended up getting a job in ohio where i ended up teaching at the high school that firstnameb lastnames went to.
He got pretty good at soccer and was able to kick the ball quite a long way and had been out there for a little bit when he kicked it really far.
It right went right into the picture window of the house behind his house.
Because he is going through the picture window.
In the house next door was sitting mister johnson.
He was just sitting there minding his own business watching t v when the ball comes right through the window knocks over his lamp and surprises him.
He stands up.
He holds onto the ball.
He looks out the window.
So i am guessing that he is going to perhaps keep the ball.
Or he is going to go out and talk to little sammy and explain to him what he did and ask him how he is going to pay for the window.
He is leaving for school.
He has his backpack on.
Seth's mom is saying goodbye to him.
She is saying.
You know it is raining.
You really might want your umbrella.
He says.
I do not need an umbrella.
But he waves goodbye.
But he walks outside.
Yes in fact it is raining.
As he walks along it starts to rain harder.
The wind is blowing.
There is puddles everywhere.
Seth is getting really really wet.
So apparently that bothers him so much that he does go back home.
His mother tries very hard not to say.
I told you so.
And he is soaking wet.
She is trying not to say.
I told you so.
But she we do not see this happen but she hands him the umbrella.
He goes back outside with the umbrella.
Even though it is still pouring rain he is much happier and looks quite a bit dryer.
Am i going to continue to look at the picture when i tell the story?
Annie had a cat whose name was spot.
One day annie was playing outside with spot and also with her dog rover.
Rover chased the cat around the yard.
The cat ran up into the tree got to a far branch in the tree and sat down.
She was afraid that that spot the cat was not going to be able to get down.
So she called her dad and asked him to come please please help get the cat out of the tree.
So her dad used a ladder to climb up onto the first main branch of the tree.
The cat was on one of the the smaller branches branching right off of that one.
But he could not get any farther.
He ended up by accident pushing the ladder down.
Thank goodness the ladder did not hit annie.
So somebody perhaps her mom called the fire department.
So the firefighters have brought their truck along with a what looks like about the same size ladder.
They are going to help either the dad or the cat out of the tree although perhaps both.
My guess is the cat can get out of the tree anytime she wants to.
But so my guess is once they help the dad out of the tree then they will go in the house and get something nice to drink.
The cat will come down on her own.
The dog especially if they get the dog back in the house with them so that he can stop barking at everybody.
So i think that is what is going to happen.
The dad got down from the tree.
They went in the house.
The cat casually climbed back down out of the tree and disappeared behind the house.
Once there was a gentleman and he lived with his wife.
They have a lovely little girl.
But unfortunately the wife died and over the course of time the man was lonely.
So he met another woman that he wanted to marry.
This woman had three daughters.
He brought her to his home.
He introduced her to his daughter.
As time went on and this woman.
They were all living together.
It became apparent that the mother who of course was the stepmother of cinderella was favoring her daughters quite a bit more than she was the man's daughter.
In fact the the man's daughter had to do so much work and ended up spending her nights by the fireplace instead of the bed.
So she was covered with ashes from the fireplace.
So they started to mock her calling her cinderella.
In the kingdom where this family lived was a king who had a son who was a very handsome prince.
So the king decided to have a ball to introduce his son to all the ladies in the land so that he could find someone to marry.
Because the king was very anxious for his son to marry.
So they send out invitations to everyone in the whole kingdom.
The invitation came to the house hero family.
They they received the invitation.
The stepdaughters go around.
The stepsisters go around and try to find all of the most beautiful things to wear.
Cinderella of course is really wanting to go to the ball too.
But the stepsisters mock her and tell her that there is no place for someone like her at the ball.
She will have to stay home and while they wear all the beautiful clothes and all that to the ball.
She spends some time talking to her animal friends about how sad she is and how much she wishes she could go to the ball.
So the evening of the ball comes and the stepmother and the stepsisters.
I honestly do not know if her father went to the ball or not.
He may have.
So they all left to go to the ball.
All of a sudden she realizes there is somebody in the room with her there.
The woman says.
I am going to help you go to the ball.
So the fairy godmother finds a pumpkin and changes the pumpkin into a coach.
Then cinderella stands there in her rags saying.
I cannot go to the ball.
I cannot go to the ball like this.
The fairy godmother does her magic.
Cinderella spins around.
Then when she comes back she is all beautifully dressed in this beautiful gorgeous ballgown and has on the most amazing slippers which in ancient french were verre which is the same homophone word as glass.
So it became in english glass.
So these were glass slippers that she wore and which sounds really uncomfortable.
Anyway she went to the ball in her beautiful coach.
The minute she walked in everybody's whispering.
They have never seen her before.
They have no idea who she is.
But her stepmother and her stepsisters are stunned by the beauty of this young woman.
And and think they probably need to go make friends with her and and see what is going on.
But the prince of course has his head completely turned.
He practically falls in love at first sight.
He asks her to dance.
They dance together.
He does not dance with anybody else the rest of the ball which makes people very very green with envy.
Oh oh i need to go back to the fairy godmother.
Because she said something very important to cinderella before she left.
She said.
You must return home.
You must leave the ball before the clocks finish striking twelve.
Because then everything will go back to the way it was.
She was dancing and having a wonderful time.
But she always wanted to pay attention to what time it was.
Well they had this one wonderful waltz.
They were waltzing around the room together.
And it was just absolutely beautiful when she heard the clock strike.
Oh and she knew she had to get out of there right away.
So she ran away without time to say anything to the prince.
He does not know what is going on.
He follows her.
She runs down the stairs.
And he is trying to to catch her.
But she knows she has to get away before everything changes back to the way it was.
As she runs down the stairs she leaves a one of her glass slippers behind.
She runs out into the street.
Whew the clock finishes striking twelve.
So she goes home.
The next day the stepsisters and the stepmother were raving about the ball and telling all kinds of stories about how wonderful the stepsisters were and how many men were following them around including the prince.
Except then they started kind of talking about this young woman who was dancing with the prince and kind of monopolizing his time.
When all of a sudden the rest of the the the kingdom hears this amazing news that the prince needs to find the owner of the glass slipper.
His his his major gentleman in waiting takes the glass slipper around on the pillow and has every woman in the land try it on.
But in many versions the stepsisters cannot of course put their feet into the slipper.
So they cut off their toes.
They cut off their heels.
There are all kinds of stories like that which i will just will not get into.
"But eventually there is cinderella in her rags covered with cinders dirty dusty , her hair a mess."
The prince's gentleman holds out the pillow with the glass slipper on it.
She not only slips her foot into the glass slipper but has the other glass slipper for some reason and puts that on too.
The prince shows up.
The prince whisks her away to the castle.
They get married.
They live happily ever after.
Oh i would get the bread out and open up the package and take out two slices of bread.
I would get the peanut butter and the jelly out of the fridge and get a knife.
I would open up the peanut butter first and spread the peanut butter on one of the slices of bread with the knife.
Then i would open up the jelly and spread the jelly on the other slice of bread.
"Then i would close the sandwich , put one on top of the other with the peanut butter and jelly in the middle."
Then i would cut it in half.
Okay in let us see.
In the late nineties my husband and i were living in vermont.
Our kids were finished with high school our and and moving on to make plans for themselves.
My husband was working for an international company that had its headquarters in zurich switzerland.
They were looking to expand the their work in firstnamej's particular area of expertise as far as marketing goes in europe.
So they asked him and another guy who had a similar job to his in the company to interview to to have a job over there.
So turned out that they preferred firstnamej of the two.
So they asked him to move over to switzerland.
But we knew that we were going to have to leave our beautiful place in vermont.
I mean vermont.
We lived there for twenty years.
We loved it very much.
But we knew we were going to have to leave eventually.
Because this job was just going to take him somewhere else.
So we thought.
So we decided to.
He went over a year before i did and found us a place and did all the you know stuff you have to do to get used to living in another country all by himself.
Which you know bravo him.
Then i went over and joined him after our daughter got married in june of ninety nine.
We lived.
The funny thing was we lived in a very very modern little apartment complex.
We did a lot of.
Not you know now that i think about it when we lived in switzerland we did not travel around europe quite so much.
But we did do a lot of traveling in switzerland and and walking around our village.
Because switzerland does not have anything like urban sprawl.
So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms.
Because the swiss love to walk.
So we could walk like to the next village or through and basically going by the fields.
Or we could walk through the woods.
They had paths going through the woods.
So his company meanwhile bought a french scale company.
Firstnamej worked for weighing.
In his case it was weighing heavy duty trucks and railroad cars.
They bought a scale company in france.
So we were asked to move to franch which was like throwing me into the briar patch.
So in in zurich they speak german which was okay.
But i had taken a little german.
My grandfather spoke german as a child.
My dad learned a lot of german.
But i just bare barely learned some.
But so in june of two thousand we moved to france to a city.
This time it is called a city called lille which is about an hour's drive north of paris almost on the belgian boarder.
Very different part of france than you usually think of.
Let me give you an example.
People cut in line.
They end up in this great big huge mob instead of lines.
It is frustrating for people who are line standers by nature which americans tend to be and british tend to be.
We lived in a apartment on the top floor of a five floor apartment building.
We had a beautiful they call terrace.
We had a table out there.
The street that we lived on had been a canal up until the nineteen thirties when it was filled in and then made a large avenue out of it.
We i made friends.
We did a lot of traveling at that point a lot of traveling in france.
We went to england a lot went to denmark spain germany not really.
I i forget why we did not go to germany very much.
My french got extremely good much better than it had been.
Firstnamej's french got really good too.
So we had a great time.
He loved to play soccer.
He was practicing kicking the soccer ball.
Unfortunately he kicked it a little too far and a little too hard.
It ran went right through the picture window of the house next door.
The man who lived in the house next door mister brown was sitting on his sofa watching tv when the ball came crashing through his picture window and knocked over his lamp.
What am i trying to say?
That is the word i was looking for.
He was startled.
So he stood up grabbed the ball and stood looking out the window at george trying to decide if he wanted to make a big deal out of this or not.
He finally decided he would just go over and talk to george and and tell george that he would like him to to pay for that broken window.
One day a little boy named tommy was getting ready to leave the house to walk to school.
He had his backpack on his back.
His mom was saying goodbye to him.
But she had heard that it was going to be raining that day.
So she encouraged him to take an umbrella.
Well he decided that was the last thing he wanted to do.
So he waved goodbye to his mom and did not take the umbrella.
He walked outside and realized oh it was raining just a little.
Then he started to realize that oh my gosh it was raining a huge amount.
In fact there were puddles forming already.
So he tried to keep his head dry with his hands.
But of course that does not work really well.
Ran back to the house where his mother was waiting for him a little impatient to realize that he had not followed her advice originally.
But he gets dried off.
He takes the umbrella and walks to school and stays a little more dry.
Alright so a little girl named cynthia was out for a walk with her dad one day.
They actually were just in their front yard when they realized that their cat was following them.
So they stopped near the tree.
They tried everything they could think of to get the cat to come down.
Meanwhile the dog is continuing to bark and scaring the cat.
So the dad ran to the garage and got the ladder brought it out to the tree and climbed up the ladder to get onto the branch near where the cat was sitting.
But as he moved from the ladder onto the branch the ladder fell over.
So finally the dad realized this was not going to happen.
So he yelled to cynthia's mom in the house to call for help.
So the only people she could think of the help were the fire fireman firefighters.
So she called them.
They came racing towards the tree with a ladder to help the dad down.
The dog was barking at the firefighters also.
But they managed to ignore the dog and got the dad out of the tree.
At which point of course the cat just gracefully walked where the branch joined the tree and climbed right back down the tree.
They all went home and had lunch.
I mean go.
I do not believe i do.
Once upon a time there was a wealthy gentleman who had a lovely wife and a sweet little daughter.
Unfortunately the wife got very ill and died.
The eventually the father decided that he really wanted to marry again.
So he went out into the city and found another woman that was interested in marrying him.
So he chose to marry her.
She had three daughters of her own who were just a little older than young girl that the the man had.
When they moved into the house all was well for a while.
But as time went on it became more and more clear that the stepmother the new wife was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter.
Eventually it got so bad that the the gentleman's daughter was really forced to do all the work in the house.
The daughters of the new wife really got to sit around all day.
In fact they made cinderella sleep or in next to the fireplace.
She ended up being covered in ashes from the fireplace.
So they nicknamed her cinderella to make fun of her.
Time went on and cinderella's only friends really were the animals in the household all of them including the dog and cat and mice and even the rats were her friends.
So time went on and they all grew older.
So they lived kingdom with a king who lived palace in the center of the city.
He had a son.
The king wanted his son the prince to marry.
Well the prince had a hard time finding someone that he really cared about.
The king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the kingdom.
So they decided to have a ball where all the young ladies in the kingdom would be invited.
He and the prince would have a chance to meet somebody that he would like to marry.
They hoped.
The everybody received an invitation.
The stepmother received their invitation and was of course very excited.
Cinderella was reading it over her shoulder.
They the stepmother told the three stepsisters about the ball.
So everybody was running around getting all prepared and finding dresses and finding hairdos and beautiful shoes.
Finally after all that work it came down to the day of the ball.
Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find something that she herself could wear.
But of course she could not find much of anything great.
So it looked pretty raggedy.
So the stepsisters laughed at her and said.
You cannot go to the ball looking like that.
Nobody would want to see you.
The stepsisters were decked out in all their fancy regalia.
The stepmother was beautifully dressed herself.
They took the family's coach and left to go to the ball.
Leaving cinderella behind near the fireplace crying.
Well as she was crying something happened.
She looked around.
There was a very sweet older lady standing there.
He apparently traveled a lot.
The so anyway the the woman introduced herself to cinderella telling her that she was her fairy godmother.
Well cinderella was taken aback quite quite thrilled at this whole possibility.
So the fairy godmother said.
You will go to the ball.
She i think the very first thing she did was to to create a beautiful ball gown for cinderella.
Lovely tiara type thing to put in her hair.
Beautiful slippers to put on her feet which were very unusually made out of glass.
But cinderella said.
How can i get to the ball?
The carriage is gone.
I cannot walk especially not in glass slippers.
So the fairy godmother worked her magic and created a carriage out of a pumpkin.
I think made the rats into horses.
So anyway there they were all set ready to go to the ball.
"So cinderella left in her all her finery and went to the ball , walked in and the whole place came to a hush."
Everybody's looking at her thinking.
So he immediately asked her to dance.
After they had one dance he was really not interested in anybody else.
So they had a lovely time.
Suddenly though cinderella remembered the most important thing that the fairy godmother had told her which was at the stroke of midnight she had to leave the ball.
Because if by the end of twelve bell strikes she was still there everyone would see that she was really dressed in rags and all of her servants were rodents.
So she she was remembering that thinking.
Oh i really have to be careful.
But she was so carried away by this lovely time she was having with the prince.
He was so falling so much in love with her that time went on really fast.
All of a sudden bang she heard the first stroke of midnight.
So she ran.
She said.
I have to go.
The prince ran after her.
The prince's fancy servant ran after her.
She is running down the steps of the palace.
Because she is going so fast she leaves behind one of her glass slippers which they pick up.
But they still cannot catch her.
Meanwhile she runs around the corner and is turned back into her regular self.
The the stepmother and the stepsisters came home from the ball all just really pretty disappointed.
Because things really had not gone the way the expected them to.
They really thought that the prince was going to fall in love with one of the stepsisters even though they may have been fooling themselves a little bit about this.
The next day it was put about in the city that the king needed to find the owner of this shoe.
So the prince's servant carried around a pillow with the glass slipper on it and walked around to all the houses in the land to have each woman who had been to the ball try on the slipper to see if it would fit.
Apparently nobody actually looked at cinderella to see what she looked like so they could try to find her that way.
But that is how it often happens in fairy tales.
So the the finally they came to the house of the gentleman and his new wife and stepsisters and cinderella.
The stepsisters were convinced that all they had to do was fit into that shoe.
We will not go into details about how they did that.
But there is cinderella kind of being there in the corner.
The prince's servant looks around and sees her and says should not this one try.
The stepmother says.
"Cinderella comes out , sits down , puts on the shoe."
It fits perfectly.
She has the other one and puts that on her feet.
"Immediately of course once she has the slippers on , her dress transforms into the same beautiful dress that she wore to the ball."
"The prince quickly makes his way to the house , embraces her and asks her to marry him."
They decide to get married that very day.
They lived happily ever after.
This is what i had for breakfast yesterday.
Bebecause we had no power.
Oh well i did not have jelly.
Bebecause i do not like jelly.
So let us see.
You take the bread out of its wrapper and put the two pieces side by side on the plate.
Then you find the peanut butter which i usually keep in the cupboard and the jam or the jelly which i usually keep in the refrigerator.
Then you clap them together with the peanut butter and jelly on the inside of course.
Then you take your knife.
You cut the peanut butter sandwich straight down the middle not diagonally.
Because that leaves corners that you then have to eat dry.
You cut it right down the middle.
I have one thing i could say.
So i cannot go there.
Probably the most important thing that is happened in our lives was the day he had the stroke.
How much detail do you want?
At the time he had his stroke he was working as an executive at a gasoline company.
He had a different position by then.
But he was doing an audit of a gasoline station.
We owned some gift shops that i managed.
I had come home early because my daughter was ill and school had said come pick her up.
I brought her home fed her.
I would just sent her up to bed.
She did not feel well.
It was one of the people who worked for my husband.
He he says.
Firstnamea you know i am i am here with your husband.
I know he has not been feeling well.
But this goes on and on.
But he keeps wanting to close them.
He cannot seem to talk.
I realized right away he had had a stroke just because i am a nurse.
I said to him.
He said.
I said.
Do you know how to do c p r?
He said.
I said.
Well here is what i want you to do.
I want you to first call nineoneone.
"When they do , call me back."
I said.
In the meantime i want you to go out in the front of the store and see if anyone there knows how to do c p r in case we need it.
So he did that.
He came back and said.
Well one guy says he saw it done on tv.
I am going.
He says.
But i can hear the sirens right now.
I said.
I said.
Okay i will stay on with you.
When when they get there let me talk to them.
"I will tell them what is happening , what he is taken and what his history is."
So anyway long story short they took him to a hospital on the south side of indianapolis.
I jumped into my car with an eleven year old and a.
I had a bag phone.
Even that was not something everyone had.
I had it because of the business that i needed to be able to be reached because we had these two stores i went between.
I called my church and asked if a certain person was there who was a friend and and ran the preschool and said.
Tell her i need her.
"So i stopped at the church , picked her up."
She went with us.
We got to the hospital which is like another world from where i live.
He when i finally was allowed to see him he was on a gurney.
He was propped up.
But there was no response.
I did all the things you think like squeeze my hand blah blah blah blah.
He did nothing.
There was no sign that he was there except that his eyes were open.
That was the beginning of a very very long you know recovery.
We we had this go on for several days in the i c u until he started improving.
Then he came home.
Not well but he could walk.
Went to outpatient therapy for a year and a half until the day they said.
We do not think he can return to his job.
They said.
Given that you have private disability insurance if he does a job trial it might show that he can do a lesser job.
That might not benefit you both financially.
There was no easing into it.
It was done.
At which point i picked up the phone knowing that while he was physically probably where he was going to be knowing he had so much more to do with speech.
I called started calling around.
I know who to call.
I was amazed to find out that indianapolis has no university based speech programs at that time anyway.
I eventually i called different hospitals at the med center.
They told me that all of the speech was in bloomington which i should have known because my sister graduated from that program back when it was not rehab.
It was all school you know therapy.
I called down there and talked to the secretary that answered.
For twelve years we drove to bloomington every week.
He gained a lot from it.
We made a lot of wonderful friends between the therapists and other clients we met.
That led to me eventually starting a program here in indianapolis.
It is modeled after the program in bloomington.
We have a young man who is out playing soccer practicing.
That soccer ball gets away from him and smashes through a window.
"That soccer ball comes right through the window , breaks the window and knocks over the lamp."
The gentleman gets up and looks out the window holding the soccer ball.
Let me look at the pictures for a moment.
So we have an independent child here.
Mom is sending him out to somewhere possibly to school because he has a backpack on.
He does not want to take the the umbrella.
She knows it is going to rain.
But he refuses.
So he waves bye.
Off he goes.
Of course it starts raining.
It rains and it rains.
It he gets wetter.
It is pouring.
He goes home to mom who is not happy to see him so wet.
He goes back out all dry but with an umbrella this time.
Mother knows best is the premise of this story.
Well apparently there was a cat.
This cat ran up the tree.
Like cats are known to do the cat was not coming down.
It looks like the dog actually possibly chased the the cat up the tree.
In the meantime we have the little girl with her tricycle.
She has called her daddy to come help get the cat out of the tree.
Daddy took a ladder to the tree.
Somehow i am going to guess also again the dog knocked the ladder down.
He has not got the cat.
There is a bird singing.
But i do not think the bird has anything to do with this story.
Somehow someone called the fire department.
You can see the firetruck parked off in the distance to help retrieve the dad and retrieve the cat.
I feel like there will be a few pages missing.
But cinderella comes to live in a.
I it appears it is her father although he never seems to appear again.
But she shows up and meets her new stepmother and the wicked stepsisters.
Instead of welcoming her they treat her as a maid.
She has to serve them etcetera.
Down the road the wicked stepmother gets an invitation to the ball.
The ball is so that the prince can be looking for a wife because his father thinks it is time.
So cinderella thinks she is going to go.
She is making do out of the attic with what she can find.
When the stepsisters see her in her homemade dress they the stepmother says she cannot go.
So they all take off for the ball.
In the meantime the mice and the fairy godmother appear and pull together a pumpkin carriage and horses and a beautiful gown for her.
Off she goes to the ball.
I i know i am missing things.
But she appears at the ball.
The prince is taken with her.
She has on these beautiful shoes.
He is doting on her until she has to be back by midnight otherwise the spell will wear off.
She hears the bell ringing and runs down the steps and loses one of the beautiful glass slippers she is wearing.
She gets home in time.
But the next day the prince is brokenhearted.
He wants this lady.
He all he has is a slipper.
So they go around the town with the slipper trying it on everyone.
Of course the the sisters think it is going to fit them.
But the the the prince puts the slipper on cinderella's foot.
It fits perfectly.
She ends up wedding the prince and lives happily ever after.
Well first you need a loaf of bread.
You need two pieces of bread preferably white bread.
Then you need peanut butter preferably without sugar added and jelly.
You need a knife.
You will spread some peanut butter with the knife onto one side of each piece i should say.
Then you will take a clean knife and put the jelly on the peanut butter.
Put the two halves together being careful it does not ooze out and drip.
There you have it a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I hate it when my mind just goes blank when i try to think of something like this.
It is interesting moments that stick out in your life you never forget.
You can remember all the details.
I remember when my first son was born.
But what i remember not so much about the twenty two hours and how tired i was but i remember so clearly the delivery room.
I do not think there are rooms that they stay in or that sort of thing.
But i think clinics type thing.
I believe it is two or three stories high.
It was a women's hospital at the time i had my first two children.
The most amazing thing about this room is that there were windows and a door with.
You go to the riley garage.
You can see it.
"There is a stairway down , a wooden stairway no less down to the ground level."
I remember the day that this wonderful thing happened.
I remember the door was open.
Can you even fathom?
I am sure there was a screen.
I remember laying there on this delivery table with this.
There was this lovely spring breeze blowing in through the door.
I know that sounds like a strange way to remember this.
But it was so unique because you would never oh my god never find that today.
So i mean yeah that is even stranger.
It was like having a home birth only in a hospital setting with everybody and everything you needed there.
But anyways you know it was a very special day.
We have a boy probably in his backyard playing soccer practicing.
He kicks the soccer ball.
It goes through a window.
We do not know if it is his home or his neighbor's home.
"But it goes through the window , breaks the glass."
Not only does it break the glass it knocks over a lamp.
There is a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by this breaking glass and plant falling over.
He gets up and goes to the window holding the ball.
That is all i can see.
I think that is all.
He is looking out the window to see who kicked the ball.
Story mom is sending her little boy off i am guessing to school because he has a backpack.
She wants him to take the umbrella.
Oh no i do not need the umbrella.
I will be fine until he gets to the third picture.
It starts raining.
It is raining.
There is puddles.
There is a downpour.
He is getting soaked.
So he turns around and goes home.
Mom looks at him rather sternly almost like you deserve it.
Hence the next picture the end of it she he sets off to school again.
This time he took mother's advice and has the umbrella.
In this picture it appears that we have a cat that the dog chased up the tree bebecause the dog is still barking.
There is a little girl trying holding her arms up hoping to catch the cat.
There is a ladder on the ground.
I am guessing that dad got the ladder and climbed up the tree to tried to get the cat.
The dog probably knocked the ladder down.
But the ladder got knocked down.
So now you have cat and dad stuck in the tree.
Someone has called the fire department.
There is a firetruck parked out on the street.
We have two firemen running towards the tree with a ladder to resolve everything.
There is one other detail and that is there is a bird on one of the branches.
This starts with the stepmother and the two daughters.
There is a gentleman in the next picture with a little girl who is cinderella who is curtsying and all pleasant.
I presume this is going to be her father.
But he never shows up again.
They the sisters and mother treat cinderella like she is a servant.
She as a result she makes friends with the animals.
Down the road the stepmother gets a letter inviting everyone to a ball at the castle because the prince's father the king thinks it time for him to find a wife.
Everyone is invited.
Cinderella thinks she is included.
So she there is a picture of her reading a book from a trunk.
The only thing i can think that is is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress or instructions.
So she is gathered whatever scraps she can find in her little attic bedroom.
Makes with the help of the mice they make a dress.
She gets ready the night of the ball to go and is told that this was not for her.
She is not allowed to go.
As i recall they rip her dress to shreds.
They go on to the ball.
She kind of goes back to her little lofty place.
The next thing we see is we got the mice and the animals around being empathetic.
Then her fairy godmother appears.
The fairy godmother whips her up a beautiful white gown and a pumpkin carriage.
I cannot remember why the horses are rearing up.
But something scared the horses.
She gets in the carriage.
The fairy godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight or it all goes away.
So she goes to the ball.
The stepmother and sisters are abhorred to see her and not happy at all.
The prince is enchanted.
They spend the evening dancing.
All of a sudden she hears the clock almost chiming to midnight.
She takes off running.
Going down the stairs she loses one of the glass slippers provided by the the fairy godmother.
The prince finds it.
She gets home.
She she is sitting with the animals looking at the glass slipper with good memories.
So now the prince still has a glass slipper.
He sends everyone out looking for the the girl with the glass other glass slipper.
When they hear about this the stepmother and the stepsisters they realize it was her.
They do not want anyone to know.
So they lock her in her room.
"However the little animals the mice especially bring a key to get her , to unlock the door so she can come down and be found to try on the slipper."
That is what happened.
She goes downstairs.
The prince realizes he is found his bride.
The last we see is they are they are getting married living happily ever after.
Well the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich is made with white bread.
So you need two pieces of white bread and a knife and a plate.
You need peanut butter.
I did not mention this before but it is much better if it does not have sugar in it.
You take maybe one to two tablespoons of peanut butter and spread it with a knife on the bread.
That depends on how you like it.
I happen to like it on both sides of the bread.
Then you take your jelly with a clean knife.
You spread that either side of the bread and put the two sides together.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Man i have lots of stories.
Well i you know the one i tell most often a bit player in it in that it it you know my when my son had cancer.
He would been having headaches and been kind of sick.
That you know it was vomiting mostly in the morning.
"So we he went on antibiotics , got a little bit better."
So we thought everything was okay.
You know after a week or so it started to go badly again.
We took him back to the pediatrician who ordered a c t scan of his sinuses.
But also just he said throw away like defensive medicine almost.
Well we will just get a c t of his whole head.
So i took him to bloomington hospital for the c t.
On the way we were listening to judaist priest.
He asked me if that was iron maiden which seems silly.
But it was the first time he recognized the style of music which was the new wave of british heavy metal and the the operatic vocals that are consistent between the two of them.
We get to the c t scan.
He does it.
First he says.
You know i tell him.
I did not mean to talk to you.
He was trying to call the pediatrician and inadvertently actually got me.
Pediatrician called back and then said that they would found a three and a half centimeter tumor in the back of his head so and that he should go to riley the next day.
About less than thirty minutes later he called back and said.
I spoke to the surgeon at riley.
He wants to see him now.
So we just had to pack up his stuff take him to riley.
He underwent brain surgery the next day.
Prior to brain surgery for cancer they they took us out for the consent.
The residents telling me about this potential complication called posterior fossa mutism which is a rare complication based on the location of the tumor.
That in rare cases it meant that that he would not be able to speak for a while afterward.
I mean which is funny not funny.
I mean he has to get consent.
But what choice do you have.
Well i do not want him to not have to speak for a little while.
So i am just going to let him have cancer in his brain.
What could go wrong.
So you know he he he does it.
What what i learned was that was just kind of an old archaic almost way of of describing a part of a larger spectrum of things called posterior fossa syndrome which is more than mutism.
Then they they have to sort of comeback brain regrows together.
So that is what firstnamee has.
But we spent ten months mostly at riley.
He did get to come home periodically which is why i remember having to send him with his mom one of the rare times he was able to come home immunocompromised.
So that happened.
Then we spent a month at the rehab hospital.
Pediatric rehab was at that time located at methodist but is now moved to riley.
So he did that.
We are still dealing with the ramifications of the brain trauma that comes with surgery.
So the posterior fotta fossa syndrome is i think unfortunately here to stay.
It has a host of symptoms.
So i guess the story has not really ended yet which is a bad way to end a story.
Kid's kicking a soccer ball because he does not have a basketball goal.
So he kicks the ball.
"It goes into a neighbor's house , busts out the window , breaks the guy's lamp."
So he stands up.
He is looking out the window.
He is getting ready to chuck the ball back at the kid probably in a very kind of spiteful way.
He also wants to know who the kid belongs to so that he can charge the parents for the replacement of his lamp and his window.
But by the time he gets up to look the kid has run away.
He is just stuck there with his broken window and broken lamp useless soccer ball.
Okay so now you want me to tell the story of this series of boxes.
Kid's going to go to school.
Mom says.
Hey it is raining.
You should have this umbrella.
Kid says.
I do not like umbrellas.
I do not want to hafta carry it.
It is just misting outside.
So i will see you later.
Despite mom's objection that kid should take the umbrella he takes fifteen steps out of the house and the mist turns into real rain.
He starts to get really wet and realizes the error of his ways.
"He goes back in , has to glumly admit his foolishness to his mom who gives him the i told you so look."
But then also gives him the umbrella so that he can go out and go to school even though he is still wet.
Wow i just established how bad i am at that.
This this father and daughter have a cat.
So they got a cat.
Cats cats are not super friendly and decided to climb the tree because that is also what cats do.
So out of the kindness of his heart the dad tries to get up into the tree to rescue the cat only to discover that he is not really qualified to do that.
In the meantime his dog that he also did not want but they have anyway and is super attached to him is is trying to get him down.
So he can sit on his lap and all that kind of good stuff that dogs prefer.
The daughter has been instructed to call for somebody to help.
So she does.
So the fire department arrives to get the cat out of the tree even though she is still trying to get the cat to come down.
It is not going to come down.
So the firefighters arrive only to discover that not only do they have to rescue the cat but they have to rescue this incompetent dad who bit off more than he could chew both in getting a dog that he did not want followed by getting a cat that he did not want and then getting stuck in a tree because he was too ambitious for his own good in trying to rescue the cat.
After teasing the dad relentlessly for a solid five minutes they all go about their their business.
Okay so the slides begin with the introduction of cinderella's father to her future or maybe even already married then.
Father dies although that that is not in the slide.
"She has to start cleaning , doing all the heavy lifting."
In the meantime she is befriended a bunch of animals and stares longingly for or at the the castle where the prince lives.
The king is looking for a suitor for his son to take over.
Invitations go out.
Although that is not depicted either.
Cinderella or enlists the animals in helping her create a dress that she can wear which is successful.
But the relentless cruelty of the stepsisters is such that they tear the dress.
They make it unwearable.
"At which point she uncovers the secret of the fairy godmother who comes , gives her horse and carriage a brand new dress."
She goes on to the ball.
She and the prince have a really nice time.
She has to leave by midnight because everything goes back.
She leaves her shoe by accident.
Even though when everything else reverts back to what it was the shoe for some reason is not causing the prince to undertake a kingdom wide search for the owner of the shoe.
She they make it to cinderella's house at which time the stepmom and stepsisters work really hard to sabotage any attempt to have it fit anybody else's foot.
But they fail.
It fits on cinderella's foot.
They realize it is the same person.
She and the prince live happily ever after from that point.
How how detailed do you want this?
This is an exercise i did in elementary school one time.
You need at least two slices of bread and a butter knife.
You can put it on one side of both slices.
But that is doing it wrong.
So you can put it on one one side of one slice.
You wipe off the the blade on the clean slice bebecause this is where your other stuff's going to go.
Then you put the lid back on the peanut butter.
Put it away bebecause you do not want to clean up later.
You put it same side of the same slice of bread where you have just cleaned the blade with the peanut butter so that there is a little bit of peanut butter there but not enough to disrupt the even spreading of the jelly which you then proceed to spread from all the way from crust to crust all across it.
At that point you do not have anything left to wipe it on.
So you actually have to just go ahead and clean the butter knife maybe in the sink.
Or if you are lazy you just stick it in the dishwasher or make one of your kids clean it whatever.
You take the two pieces of bread.
You put them together with the peanut butter facing the jelly so that they intersect.
Squeeze them together but not too hard bebecause you do not want it to come out the sides.
Then you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well you know i i try not to belabor the same points.
But you know it was one of my more fun memories was surprising our daughter with a trip to disneyworld when she was six about six.
I travel a fair amount for for my job.
At least i used to.
So but she grew up with with the disney princesses.
She would love disney movies was really little like two or three.
We had to stop letting her watch mary poppins and bedknobs and broomsticks because she was developing a british accent.
We had to kind of dial dial back the frequency with which she was watching those movies.
So you know we got up early one morning.
And we told her that you know we are driving me to the airport because you know i got to fly out for work.
Then when we got to the airport we turn around.
That is not really what is happening.
You know we are all packed.
We are going to disneyworld.
She did not react at all.
Then we repeated it.
Well maybe when it sinks in she will be really excited.
It was as much reaction as we got from this uber disney child with a surprise visit to disney.
So but i enjoyed it anyway.
So this kid's out kicking a soccer ball trying to entertain himself while quarantined.
He is by himself remaining appropriately socially distant but does a bad job of controlling the ball.
So it breaks through the window of the neighbor's living room.
"Comes through the window , breaks the lamp next to the neighbor who is shocked to discover that one he has a neighbor."
Two this kid kicked a ball hard enough to break his window.
But by then the kid has run away because he was terrified that he would be in trouble.
He did not really like soccer that much anyway.
There is not a lot of room here.
So this is a situation where this kid hasta go to school.
Mom notices that it is raining and says.
Hey billy you need to take this umbrella bebecause otherwise when you get out to the busstop you are going to be all wet.
Little billy gets halfway to the bus stop discovers that it is in fact raining.
Now not only is it raining but it is coming down hard.
So he turns around.
"He is all wet , rolls back to the house to find his mom who tries not to gloat but on the inside is gloating and saying."
Yeah i i told you.
He went off to school that day and and probably learned a valuable lesson but possibly not.
So this is a situation in which the fire department has been dispatched to rescue the father with dementia who has been wandering and got himself treed for some reason.
Probably because he was not thinking very clearly.
But in the meantime a really aggressive dog has discovered that this demented man is in the tree.
And because it is just a really kind of a jerk dog is really getting after it barking at him very vicious to the point where he is completely ignoring the child trying to get her cat who is also now scared out of the same tree.
When if the dog really wanted she is right there to bite.
But for whatever reason he is locked on to this man.
But we do not know that part.
So that is the situation plays out here.
This little girl and her cat are completely unrelated to what is happening.
They kind of stumbled upon this bizarre scene as witnesses.
Even as the the firefighters show up to ask her about what is happening she does not have any idea.
She just knows that her cat's stuck up there.
She dragged her own ladder out to try to get him down.
But evidently it it it failed because she just left it lying on the ground.
So that is the situation find it.
I am sure that eventually the the dog will have to be taken to animal control or given back to the owner with an admonition to do a better job of keeping him restrained.
Since the firefighters are there they go ahead and and get the the the man and try to locate where he belongs you know.
I am sure there was a silver alert isher issued for him at some point.
So that is the the the outcome as it relates to him.
Then since they were there they went ahead and got the cat out of the tree for the little girl and kind of as a bonus.
So cinderella's introduced to her now stepmother and stepsisters by her dad who for some reason cannot tell that these people suck.
Then he mysteriously vanishes.
I think he dies.
But there is not a lot of sympathy there.
So at that point the stepmother and stepsisters treat cinderella poorly effectively turning into her into an indentured servant.
Meanwhile as a result of her duties cinderella was befriending a bunch of the animals because the only people that can hang out with her are the animals while daydreaming about how nice it would be to live a better life like royalty maybe.
Simultaneously the king's looking for an heir.
They need offspring for the line to continue to foster the patriarchy.
So they decided to throw a ball to find a suitable mate for the son.
The the the announcements go out.
Cinderella asks if she can go and is laughed out of the building so to speak.
But she gets creative and with the help of her animal friends creates a really nice dress.
But once she is in the dress and trying to go the stepsisters and stepmother make sure that that is not going to be the way that it goes.
They they they tear the dress.
It looks awful.
"So enter the fairy godmother who in answer to cinderella's unspoken pleas grants her one night with this beautiful dress , a horse and carriage made from a pumpkin and some of her animal friends and these glass slippers."
She makes it to the ball.
She has a wonderful time with the prince.
But by midnight when everything is supposed to revert back she has to roll out.
In the course of doing that she leaves one of the glass slippers in her rush.
Everything except for the glass slipper reverts back to what it was before.
But now smitten there has to be a search for the wearer of this glass slipper for the prince who is then going around seeing if it fits anybody.
When he arrives at cinderella's home the stepmother and stepsisters do everything possible to interfere and and force it to fit someone else.
But it only fits cinderella.
They discover that that is who that is.
She and the prince get married and live happily ever after.
So you have to have the appropriate ingredients.
Maybe a spoon if you are feeling really frisky or if you have gotten lazy and you have the squeezable jelly or squeezable peanut butter.
But but generally i i view that kind of lazy.
"So you get the bread out , two slices side by side."
You you really can start with either the peanut butter or the jelly.
So it really does not matter.
But whichever one you choose you take the lid off.
You can clean the knife by wiping it on the other slice of bread.
You put the lid back on whichever one that you opened first.
No wrong way to do this.
Then you take the lid off the other one.
You put the two slices together with the peanut butter facing the jelly.
You do not have to.
You can cut it.
Some people do it diagonal.
Some people do it other ways.
Some people do not do it at all.
There is more than one right way to do it.
But you put those things together.
You have got your sandwich.
You clean off your knife.
You put your lid back on the peanut butter or jelly whichever you did second.
You put the the peanut butter and the jelly away.
You have got a sandwich.
My we were scheduled to go on vacation.
We were supposed to go on vacation.
I had a report that was going to be due.
My company actually said that if i could not get it done before i left well they would just cover the extra airfare and send me later.
I really worked hard to get it done.
I really wanted to go.
We were heading to germany for eleven days.
He would planned out this wonderful trip to all of the places and the museums that i wanted to go to that i had been longing for years to see.
He did not think it all out through though.
What his intentions had been did not work out because the settings were not just what he expected.
They have cleared it out and reserved it just for us.
I kept telling them.
He is not going to be romantic.
Let us just go and eat dinner.
We will drink beer afterwards.
Bulls they let the dog in the room.
He weighed about a hundred forty pounds.
When he stood up was about six six.
He never left my side while we were visiting.
My husband's kicking the dog.
Why are you kicking the dog?
So when he could not get up from behind the table and propose on his knee he had to do it across the table bebecause the darn dog would not get out of his way.
On a long range kick he knocks it through the neighbor's window startling the neighbor and breaking his lamp.
The neighbor looks outside.
But he just chuckles bebecause he remembers being a boy.
You are going to school.
Why do not you take an umbrella today.
I will not need it.
I will wait at the bus stop and then walk the rest.
Now of course it starts sprinkling.
Then it starts pouring.
He walks back inside.
Well i warned you.
So he does as his mother says and takes the umbrella and has a much better day.
She noticed that her cat had gotten out of the house and climbed the tree.
She is totally crying and wants to have it better.
So her dad grabs a ladder and climbs up the tree.
Then the dog is saying.
Hey you are not supposed to be up there.
What is going on?
So then the mom has to call the fire department to have them come out and fix it.
All in all he is going to be mortified and humiliated.
The cat will probably jump down on its own.
Cinderella was a little farm girl whose dad actually did have somewhat of a title but only because he inherited it from her mother.
When her mother passed away he remarried.
He remarried.
She brought the two stepdaughters.
I am cannot remember the name of the other one.
So giselle who is cinderella in the story she tries her best to make friends and to do everything that her stepmother and her two sisters demanded her.
When she always dreams for a better time and a better life.
So it comes around as she is day dreaming at the castle she hears tales of a ball.
Sure enough the invitation comes.
All eligible females in the kingdom are to come to the ball to meet the prince for he will pick out his wife.
So she goes and decides to take her mother's dress and convert it back into her own.
The little mice help as well.
They have a wonderful song that they sing as they do this.
Now once the sisters find out they are very displeased.
So they tear apart her dress to shreds.
At this point they leave for the ball.
She runs to the garden to cry.
Her fairy godmother shows up and says.
Oh no dear we will make this right.
The pumpkin the lizards the mice they all turn into her chariot her horse and the carriageman she needs.
The dress is fixed and turned into a beautiful gown.
She gets to go to the ball.
At the ball she meets the prince.
But she does remember she has to be home by midnight.
So she runs from the ball as he chases her.
She throws a shoe because the girl could not keep her shoes on.
As she is running home it is almost midnight.
It does strike midnight.
Everything's returned to normal.
She still had a wonderful evening and remembers it as that saves the one shoe and takes it up and puts it up in her trunk.
So when the prince and his people start going around the kingdom to find the girl who fit the shoe they go to every household.
One cuts off her toes.
One cuts off her heels til they fit in the shoe.
But no the birds avenge them.
So cinderella finally gets to try on the shoe.
It fits.
She gets to marry the prince.
But she also forgives her evil stepmother and her sisters.
I would go to the bread cabinet and open it up and pull out a loaf of bread.
I would untwist the ties and take two pieces of bread and set them on the plate.
They need to match and go this way when they are open so the crusts all line up.
It has to be that way.
We would go into the cabinet and get the peanut butter.
Both jars would need to be opened.
Now first i would take the peanut butter and smear it onto one half of the bread.
Then i would take the peanut butter knife and clean it off on the other side of the bread just to make sure that it is not going to cross contaminate the peanuts into the jam which it is really going to do anyway but not that bad.
Then we get the jam and smear it on that side of the bread.
Once this is complete both pieces are lined up together.
One paper towel is wrapped across the bottom so that the crumbs do not come out.
You can eat it with your hands and not have to worry about a plate.
So i was working from home and decided to go into the office.
But i just had this feeling bebecause my brother inlaw and his wife they were expecting.
So i am driving around.
I am going to go get flowers and drop them off at their house.
I pick up the flowers.
Yeah i i do not think this is where i am supposed to go.
So it is connected.
I start getting these messages.
So bam slam tiki man i go straight to the hospital.
I am there less than two hours after he is born.
"I have taken him to europe , all kinds of different adventures here in the united states."
I love them both.
Then here when they had the latest one it is just been so great.
I think this is what grandmas feel like.
Oh my god you had a grandbaby early.
I wish i was pele.
But i live in the united states.
So when i kick my soccer ball boom it hits the neighbor's picture window.
He is not very excited because you just ruined his afternoon hanging out in the den.
He finds the the the ball and is like.
I cannot see any more of the picture.
I think he looks angry.
But he is he is peeved someone kicked a soccer ball through his window.
There is going to be an insurance claim involved.
He will probably get back on his home owner's insurance.
He is going to be mad about it and try to take it up with his neighbor or owner the parental guidance of the child.
As long as he is under twelve the owner of the house is screwed.
The parents do not have to pay for it.
So it is time to go to school and wait for the bus.
No mom i do not need an umbrella.
So i go outside in scene three.
Oh it is starting to rain.
Yeah it is raining.
I took the umbrella.
I am going back to the bus stop.
I still have to go to school.
I did not change my clothes or my shoes or my backpack.
Well kitty cat climbed up the tree.
Baby girl still cannot get her to come down.
She will have to jump off of her tricycle to do it.
Daddy put a ladder up to try to help.
So the fire department got called because not only do they have to save the baby kitty in the tree but the dad in the tree.
Everyone is mortified but the bird.
The bird thinks it is funny.
He keeps tweeting and singing.
So cinderella grew up in a loving home and with her mother and father.
Her father a merchant her mother a duchess i believe.
But at one point her mother passed away.
Her father went on a business trip where he was hit in the face with a thatchet and passed away as well.
So coming back he was supposed to bring her a small present.
That did not happen.
But he did bring back this wonderful stepmother and her two stepdaughters brunhelda and giselda.
I think that is their names.
I should have looked it up.
So these two girls were incredibly spoiled brats.
But cinderella giselle being the kind person that she was wanted to make them feel happy at home and loved.
So she took care of them until her father passed away unexpectedly.
She still took care of the family because her stepmother was the only mother that she ever knew.
As time went on there was to be a ball.
He had not picked the princess.
She was going to be decided at the ball.
So when the ball came up the stepdaughters were totally evil and destroyed the dress that giselle cinderella had made.
Her dress was then taken care of by her fairy godmother.
"Her fairy godmother also turned the pumpkin into a carriage , the mice into footsmen , the lizards into chairmen."
But she had to be home by midnight.
It got too close to time.
She was not getting herself ready.
A couple minutes beforehand she realized her ineptitude and started running down the stairs.
She took to flight and losing a shoe in the process.
She made it most of the way home.
But most of the spells had disintegrated as she landed at her house.
However the glass slipper still survived.
The prince had his.
She had hers.
So when the prince decided to go and find his princess he drove around town on his carriages or his horse.
Made all of the eligible ladies try it on.
But he got to her sisters' house.
Oldest sister could not fit.
So she cut off her heel.
That did not work.
The birds plucked her eyes out.
Younger sister cut off her toe.
That did not work.
The birds plucked her eyes out.
Then she got to cinderella giselle.
It fit.
She did offer a forgiveness for those other two sisters.
But rather than wandering through the woods blind and sullied in their foot they would just have to wander the woods.
Noone would give them grief.
So you go in the kitchen.
You open up the breadbox.
You take out the bread.
You open the bread from the twist tie and retrieve two pieces of bread.
Noone wants to eat it.
One side of the the bread is going to get the peanut butter.
It is not kept cold.
You are going to smear the peanut butter on with the knife that you took from the utensil drawer onto the bread.
Now you are going to take what is left of the rest of residue and wipe it onto the side you are going to put the jelly.
You are going to open up the fridge.
You are going to take out your jelly jar.
I recommend the very berry made with honey non high fructose syrup.
So you are going to use that and start schmearing it all over that side of the bread.
We will press these two pieces together to make it really yummy and special.
You are going to make sure that the top and bottom corners are kind of even because they are better that way.
You need to put your side dish in there.
That can be celery sticks radish chips with french dip which i recommend or cheetos.
Two of them dropped out partway through the trip.
Bebecause they they did not consider it safe.
But a fascinating trip to see that that part of the world.
We paddled in one case past two days of forest fires on one bank of the river.
We hadta put cloths over our mouths to to be able to breathe properly because the smoke was quite heavy.
But we did paddle a lot.
We paddled nine or ten hours a day to to keep going.
We we averaged about seventy two kilometers a day on on on the paddling.
You cannot see a half inch into the water.
So we hadta find side streams that were clear in order to get fresh water to be able to drink.
Okay the the story is a boy was playing soccer.
He kicked the soccer ball.
"It went through the window of a house and broke the window and landed in in the living room , knocked over a lamp."
The man was sitting in the chair next to the lamp.
He picked up the soccer ball and looked out the window to see where it had come from.
A woman was giving her child an umbrella.
It was saying they did not need the umbrella and left it with her mother and then went outside.
It began to rain.
The child ran home and was all wet.
He went back outside after he would got dry clothes and with the umbrella that he should have had in the first place.
Cat went up in a tree.
A man went up to retrieve the cat using a ladder.
The ladder has fallen down.
So the man had trouble getting out.
The dog was barking up the tree for no particular reason that i can see.
The firemen had been called to rescue now both the cat and the man.
Cinderella lived with her aunt.
They always gave her the dirty jobs to do around the house.
They the the nasty stepsisters were invited to a ball in the castle.
They got dressed up to go.
The the good fairy came and waved her magic wand and gave cinderella a wonderful dress and and slippers glass slippers to wear to the ball.
Then she went to the ball where she captured the interest of the prince who danced with her and and fell in love with her.
But the problem was the cinderella hadta leave at midnight.
"Bebecause the coach that she came in , which the good fairy had created from a pumpkin and mice , would change back into a pumpkin."
So she ran out.
"But as she ran she lost one of the slippers the the glass slippers , which the prince recovered."
Then he went searching throughout his kingdom to try and find the the girl or the woman who matched the slipper.
He came to the house where where cinderella was with her stepsisters.
Cinderella tried was allowed to try the shoe.
It fit.
And she went off to marry the prince and live happily ever after.

I have a very vivid memory of being left with my sister and having our a young woman who was taking care of us at home while my mother worked at the office with my dad at his store.
My sister and i were playing.
This young gal wanted me to go to have a nap in the afternoon in the summer day out.
I was protesting.
"I went into the bedroom , waited a few minutes and snuck out of the house and then walked on my own dumps through the downtown to my dad's store."
I did.
Well you know you are winnipeg was a smaller city.
I knew the way.
I being in the car the kids they pick it up fast.
So yes you asked for memory.
Well the first one is this kid kicks the ball.
"It looks like it breaks a window , goes through the window where a guy's sitting there."
Then the man that is sitting there picks up the ball and is looking out the window in the broken pane.
One seems to have an umbrella.
She is looking to give it to her daughter.
Who the daughter takes it.
Unless she takes it.
We cannot tell that.
Starts to rain.
Does not look like the daughter takes it actually.
Well so up in paragraph three it is raining.
Kid comes home looks like all wet.
Then the kid takes the when it is raining again.
Well there is a man stuck in a tree.
The dog is barking.
The girl's trying to get the cat off the tree.
She is got a little tricycle there.
There is a ladder.
But now on come the fireman to help him get down from the tree.
What do you want me to tell you?
Cinderella a young girl who lived with an a stepmother and two stepsisters who tormented her.
She did all the work around the house.
She was treated very badly.
So one day an invitation comes sent by the royalty that there is going to be a big ball.
Of course the prince is going to be there.
They plan out what they are going to wear and how excited they are and what a great occasion it is going to be.
Cinderella wants to go but they make fun of her you see.
They say.
What if she cannot go to this?
So they ultimately get all dressed up and go to the ball one night.
Cinderella's left behind.
Then along out of the blue comes this fairy godmother who has a magic wand.
She basically turns all her rags into wonderful clothes.
He makes a coach out of a pumpkin.
Her both horses suddenly emerge.
She is whisked away to the ball.
She is given a warning that before she sets foot out of the coach.
You know the fairy godmother tells her.
You hafta be home by midnight or everything's going to turn back to what it was.
Lo and behold she goes to the ball.
Princess has danced with all the women at the ball.
But nothing would have struck his fancy.
But then he sees cinderella.
They are just having a great time.
Then she suddenly realizes it is close to midnight.
"She rushes down the stairs , leaves a slipper behind or one of her shoes behind."
She gets into the chariot and heads home.
But she is lost her shoe.
There she is working away still.
Then there is an announcement that the prince is trying to find somebody that matches the shoe.
He still has the shoe.
He wants wants to find the match.
Anyways he goes around from home to home in all the kingdom and comes to the home where cinderella lives and tries it on the stepsisters.
Of course it does not work.
They ask if anybody else is there.
Sure enough the they they they pretend she is not there.
But ultimately she she gets a crack at it and tries it on.
Well he she ends up happily with the prince.
My granddaughter of five could probably do it better.

I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk about it for eight.
That was something that happened that was very important.
I have no idea why i was accepted because i do not think i met any of their criteria except i probably filled the quota for mature students so that they could show that they had a diverse program.
I was thirty two when i started.
So i guess i was thirty one when i applied.
I mean they still remembered high school.
Who thought about high school?
They all knew each other from high school.
They were there because they did not get into medical school or bebecause their parents wanted them to be there or bebecause their parents were lawyers.
"I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came with no commitment whatsoever , no caring about the issues or the institution."
Well i guess it was the best thing that they could do under the circumstances.
I was there bebecause i just really cared.
So i really did not fit in really.
It was at the end of the first year when i made my first real friend.
Up until then i was friendly with people but i did not understand the limits of that friendliness.
It was very limited because we were told to get into study groups.
I never spoke in class because i could never understand what they wanted.
They asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious.
Why would anybody say the obvious?
So people said the obvious.
They were rewarded.
So those were the people sought after to be in the study groups.
So i did almost everything alone for the entire year.
When i asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she hadta get permission from her group because they could not share notes outside the group.
So i said.
Somewhere along the line i found a group that really did not give a shit.
Just anybody who wanted to could be part of it.
At the end of the year in the subway station i met someone who i am still friends with who i just adore.
But we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy five people.
So i never saw her.
In second year things improved a bit because then i think i made a second friend.
Once i had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one or two in the year ahead so that was a bit better.
"As an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the students who all thought they were special , we had one class in second year with a teacher who was really a decent person."
He said.
Please when you write your exams do not think that your mark is a reflection of your quality as a human being.
I thought.
I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged this teacher because he was not bright.
It was in law school that i learned that competent was a derogatory term.
So because he was not bright the students did not respect him.
I made the mistake of saying to someone.
You know yeah okay but he is decent.
He has a heart.
She said.
I did not come to oz where this one does not have a brain and this one does not have a heart.
I came to law school.
I do not know why.
I also did not understand that law schools had their own kind of bent and that u of t was law and economics.
I did not even get it until after i left.
I really should have gone to york.
But when i came to toronto people were saying.
Why would you want to be way out at york?
You want to be downtown.
So i thought.
Okay i want to be downtown.
It knocks over the lamp.
The man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see who threw it presumably.
It looks like he is got his gun in the pocket.
Okay the mother tells the child to take an umbrella.
The child does not want one.
Oh the but in the second one the child does want the umbrella.
Well oh oh oh oh oh i see.
So the mother offers the child the umbrella.
The child refuses.
The child says.
It is raining.
It is really raining.
The kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother who is not pleased and gives him an umbrella so that he can walk in the rain where it is pelting.
Well what is happening is that firefighters are rushing it looks like to save a man from a tree.
But it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was chased up the tree by the dog.
The man climbed up the tree to save the cat.
Then he got stuck.
Then the firemen are coming to save the man.
Maybe the cat was chasing the bird.
No i think the dog was chasing the cat.
Am i allowed to make it a?
"The bane of feminists everywhere , cinderella's story about a beautiful young woman who lived with her horrible stepmother and her two ugly stepsisters."
I do not think we find out how she got to that situation but clearly her father did not marry well.
The stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a slave.
She hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking and all the washing and take care of them and did not get treated nicely.
She did not get to go shopping for new clothes.
She was not given the best food to eat.
Anyway she was just treated horribly.
One day the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an invitation from the palace to come to a ball.
"Cinderella , thinking she is a member of the family thinks she can go along."
So she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get ready for the ball.
Then they go.
After they leave she is very disappointed because she really wanted to go to the ball.
Somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she can go to the ball but she has to be home by midnight.
"So she gives her a beautiful dress to wear , lovely new shoes and turns a pumpkin into a carriage , turns the mice into horsemen and horses."
So cinderella went to the ball.
She had a wonderful time.
Nobody knew who she was.
Everybody was saying.
The prince danced with her the whole evening.
She had a lovely time.
Then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta leave.
So she ran out.
"In running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper , made it to the carriage and got home just as the carriage turned into a pumpkin."
"Following that , the prince found the missing slipper."
He wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper.
So he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's feet to see if it fit.
It did not fit anybody.
Finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly stepsisters.
He tried it on their feet.
It did not fit any of them.
He saw cinderella and said.
Why do not you try it?
Or possibly she said.
Why do not i try it?
He tried it on.
It fit.
He was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after having danced with her for a few hours.
"She of of course , being swept off her feet , agreed to marry him not understanding what it would mean."
That she would just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and cooking.
But the book does not take you that far.
It only takes you to the part where they meet and they fall in love and live happily ever after.

Means we will go with our marriage.
We did not want to have a church ceremony.
So we found the jp.
We found the jp but he was way the heck and gone east of san diego.
So we drove out to this little teensy tiny town called boulevard and had a ceremony with the jp and then drove all the way back.
Then a few months later we learned that there was actually another jp in town about two miles away.
Not too many people know where boulevard is in san diego.
So kid kicks the football through the window.
He accidentally kicks it through the window.
"Knocks over a lamp , breaking the window and and probably breaking the lamp."
The guy stands up with the ball in his hand and looks out the window.
I guess he is going to get prepared to yell at the kid.
Kid goes off to school.
Mama says.
Kid says.
Kid's walking to school.
Gets rained on.
He says.
So he turns around to go back.
She is mad bebecause she offered him.
But then she give him umbrella after all.
He goes to school somewhat wet but with an umbrella.
Did he learn?
The little girl's pet cat managed to get up a tree and now cannot come down as cats are rumored to do.
But i have had plenty of cats come down from trees.
I do not know what that is all about.
The cat mighta been after a bird singing in the tree.
So a guy tried to help by climbing up the tree.
Someone had the presence of mind to call the fire department who were bringing their ladder up to rescue at least the cat if not the guy.
So somebody musta called the police.
You know less than half of all fire calls are not for fires but for things like that.
Well bearing in mind that what i know is only the the disney version.
So is is it better for me to just say what i think it is?
I guess that is the one.

Then having a real buddy and a pal as well as someone you love to get along with and have a good time as a senior is that is an important event in my life and a happy event in my life.
And he kicks the soccer ball which goes through a plate glass window right into the living room and almost onto the lap of a man sitting inside who has holds the ball and perhaps threatens not to return the ball.
This is a little boy who is about to go to school.
His mother hands him an umbrella because it is probably going to rain.
He does not want the umbrella.
He is giving it back to his mother.
He gets out.
He is discovers that it is raining and comes home soaking wet.
He is learned his lesson on this time.
He goes and uses the umbrella to keep dry.
A a dog has has chased the boy up into the tree or the.
Oh the boy went up into the tree to try and rescue the cat.
Does not look like the dog really chased the man up into the tree.
But he is barking at him.
To rescue the cat the firemen have come.
They got brought their ladder.

Well i obviously going to use the book.

"Okay i was running to my class at the university , to my finance class from my sociology class."
"Next thing i knew i woke up , looked at my wristwatch."
It said eight twenty.
The clock on the wall said five to nine.
So i assumed something had happened.
Yes something had happened.
I had two broken legs.
I remained there for three and a half months and was able to get out of bed and walked.
Walking down the hall i lost my balance on my crutches.
I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again.
Then they took me back to bed with a wheelchair.
I got into bed.
The nurse came in.
I said.
Am i going to the operating room?
She said.
I went to the operating room was put in a body cast from under my underarms to the tip of my left toe.
I had to remain in that for another eight weeks.
I finally got out of bed and learned to walk again of course.
Bebecause you cannot walk when you are in bed for that long.
I came out of the hospital.
That night i went to university to write a test.
So and then i hafta really learn to walk bebecause i was on crutches at the time.
I learned to walk.
Now i walk all over the city of toronto and in miami beach all over miami beach.
While in the hospital they would bring ambulatory patients to my room bebecause they were depressed.
"But i took the approach that when you you can do about something , do not waste your energy."
So the highlight of my day was watching jeopardy.
I have pain in my leg.
But it is going to be there.
So i cannot ruin my life with it.
Okay this boy is playing with his ball.
He kicks it.
It goes through the window of somebody is house and lands in the house.
The man finds the ball and then come is now looking out the window to see who threw the ball through his window.
Little looks like a little girl going out and her mother holding an umbrella which she does not seem to want the umbrella.
So she does not take it.
Of course it starts raining.
Then she runs back all wet.
I think it is a.
Now in some it looked like a little girl but i think it is a little boy.
There is a cat caught in the tree.
The dog is trying to get to the cats.
Looks like the father of the little girl is trying to get to the cats.
But he cannot bebecause the cat's all the way out on a branch.
They have a ladder.
Obviously looks like they will solve the problem.

Well one of the very important things that happened to me in my life is my transition from from another country moving to canada.
But it was interesting in the sense that it was just moving from one country to another.
It was you know with all these expectations and and all these challenges.
Learning you know getting used to a whole new culture.
Not language because i spoke english where i came from.
But just getting used to whole new culture and you know ways of doing things and also in the manner manner of speaking.
You know we spoke differently from how we speak here.
Well things when i started to drive was driving on the right hand side here.
We drove on the left in in guyana.
You know just getting used to consumerism.
That was one of the big shock you know.
Spend money there like we we did here.
My parents certainly did not spend money and buy clothing and shoes and and and and take the many vacations like people do here.
There was just money that is so dispensable.
I guess it is just like everything else today.
Especially in the last fifteen twenty years you know.
It is like everything has become dispensable.
You know it is like you buy a shirt.
You wear it a few times.
Then you can go get another one because it is so inexpensive now.
It is there is no premium on anything anymore.
But there is a premium on education.
That is where i invested my time.
I spent many years in education while while working and studying.
I just did it because i felt i could do it.
But i struggled through it.
Okay so he is kicking a soccer ball.
The soccer ball broke the window.
"The soccer ball went through the glass pane , broke the glass pane and went through the window into someone is living room."
"He is gotten up , the fellow who was sitting at the someone is house."
It looks like it entered in someone is house through the broken window.
He is now gotten up.
He is picked up the ball.
He is looking out to see who did that.
Okay so the mother is giving her child the umbrella because it looks like it may or may not rain.
He did not take the umbrella.
But then when he went out it started to rain.
So he i guess he regretted not taking the umbrella.
So he became wet.
He walked through the rain.
He became wet.
He went back home.
Looks like he went back home.
He got the umbrella after all.
The father is trying to get the pet.
It looks like he is stuck in the tree now as well.
The dog is barking up the tree.
But they call the fire department.
So guys are gotten their ladder.
They are going to go rescue the pet and maybe the father.

I guess the one of the earliest memories that i have is when i went to junior league camp every summer.
It was a wonderful experience because i was living in a small town where there were not very many activities.
There was not the opportunity to partake in any sort of extracurricucurricular activities.
But at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports.
They had rowing.
"They also had arts and handicrafts , music theater which i adored."
So that gave us the opportunity to have a really full and varied day.
Also what i really enjoyed was the fact that they never imposed an eating regime on us.
We could eat if we wanted.
If we did not feel like eating we did not hafta eat.
There was never anybody saying that you know you were not allowed leaving the table finished everything on your plate.
So i was in my glory because i would have just toast.
Also we resided in these cabins in the woods.
Every morning the counselors would take us swimming before breakfast.
So this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks down to the lake and go for a swim.
I do not know.
I cannot remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to the camp or not.
But it was always freezing cold.
There were all these blood suckers in the lake.
That the only way that you could get them off is was if you put salt on them.
Then you could pull them off your your leg.
"Then we would all go back , get dressed and then go and have breakfast and toast."
Then you know that would be the end of the day.
I loved camp.
We they always had lots of materials and somebody who had you know tons of ideas about different things that you could make and create.
There is painting and things that we useta create with wood and materials and stuff like that.
Then i mean i think i was only there for a week.
But it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity.
Then at the end of the week you know they would bring in the school buses and into the school bus to go back home to.
I was living in montreal at the time.
I remember i cried all the way from the camp home because it was just so much fun.
I made such good good friends and people that i really liked.
Once home i kept in contact with a lot of the people that i would met.
A lot of the the girls that i met at the camp.
Then i went to you know every year i would go back to that same camp.
I think it was for about five years in a row i went back.
So you would meet the same people over and over and over again.
Every year it is you know looking forward to seeing firstnamee or firstnameb or whoever.
So the young young man is kicking around a soccer ball.
"The soccer ball breaks a neighbor's window , goes into the neighbor's living room."
The neighbor gets up out of his chair to look out the window to see who kicked that ball and how did it break his window.
So there is a mother and her son.
She is telling him.
Look it is probably going to rain today.
You better take your umbrella.
No no no i do not need my umbrella.
Sure enough as the mother had said it starts to rain.
He does not have an umbrella.
He gets all wet.
He comes home.
"His mother frowns at him , says."
Look why you know you shoulda brought your umbrella.
So anyways she dries him off and gives him an umbrella.
Out he goes into the rain.
The only way that he could get away from the dog was by climbing a tree.
There was a dog who was chasing a cat up a tree.
So this man decided that he would try and get the cat outta the tree.
But then he got stuck up the tree.
They hadta call the fire department to get not only him but the cat down from out of the tree.
We start at page one?

I went with a group of my friends.
I think i was between eight and ten.
We went down to this local creek.
We lived in a small village.
We were cautioned not to go down because you know the creek was high.
We defied all odds.
We went down.
We always had hammers and nails that we bore from our fathers' workshops.
So we went down.
We found some logs and some odd boards.
We put together a raft.
We went rafting.
But of course we hit one point.
There was a ice floe.
The raft went sideways.
We all went into the water.
So you know and at that time we wore rubber boots.
We got soaked from the waist down.
Water went in the boots.
And then we finally made it to shore thank goodness.
Otherwise it coulda been more serious.
When we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots.
But we still had our socks on.
We hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road.
It was like slosh slosh slish slosh you know.
You know unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in the door.
What happened?
So we we got a huge reprimand you know.
So but thankfully we made it home.
But because the temperature was dropping our sort of jeans or at that time whatever we were wearing i remember they were starting to become more like cardboard you know.
They were starting to freeze.
So it was like walking walking along like a robot.
But we made it home.
But it was sad in that we got reprimanded.
But we were happy when we were doing the you know the activity itself.
So we had a good time.
You know we laughed about it.
You know we were all chummy.
We walked back.
But you know when we got home it was kind of sad.
There is no cinderella in these.
Looks like the boy is kicking what appears to be a soccer ball.
"Unfortunately it goes and breaks the window , a shuttered window with the shutters open."
In number three the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in an armchair.
"The man picks up the ball , looks out the window , glances it through the broke window , holding the soccer ball."
Can i just scan the whole story first?
"Looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy , trying to hand him an umbrella."
He says.
I do not want the umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
Upon leaving for school with his backpack it appears that the rain had commenced.
Then he is looks like he is on his way home or way back with his backpack covering his head.
Stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down arrives home totally soaked facing the mother.
She does not look too happy.
"He probably got a reprimand and was told to try again this time with an umbrella back to wherever he was going , probably school."
Okay there is a lot of action here.
Looks like there is a girl who is reaching up into a deciduous tree trying to catch her cat.
There is a tricycle.
Perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle.
There is a man up in a tree and a ladder.
Perhaps he was climbing up the tree.
Now there is a dog barking up the tree at the man.
He looks very perturbed upset because he cannot get down off the tree.
Meanwhile firefighters arrive in their truck.
Two firefighters are running with a ladder to probably in an attempt to rescue the man.
Oh a bird ing chirping on another branch.

Let me see.
I think it was second formally called now grade ten.
I started to take geometry.
I could not understand it.
Teacher kept assuring us that you will eventually you will get it and you will get it.
I got pretty good mark.
I studied hard for it the first term.
Partway through the second term just before the second set of exam for it around easter time the light came on my head.
Just like he said.
It will eventually it will come to you.
I remember one time after the easter exam i went up to him during after one of the classes.
I thanked him for giving encouragement that eventually it will come.
That gave me a lot of happiness.
Because it would have pulled down my other marks on average you see.
I tell you a story.
"Well young man was playing soccer , broke a window , landed near the owner's lap who was sitting in a chair."
Then the owner looked out the window through the broken glass to see who did it.
Do i have to give names?
The mother tells the child.
Take an umbrella because it is probably going to rain.
The child leaves.
The mother gives the umbrella.
Oh there are two children here.
The one did not take the umbrella.
It rains.
The other one who had the umbrella was walking happily.
I think.
So much action going on here.
Where do you start?
Oh no there is birds up here.

Alright when i was a kid one of the negative experiences i had with a dog occurred at lake simcoe.
I played with a gang of other children.
One day somebody teased a large dog which growled and raced at the group.
I and the kids all scattered.
By chance i happened to run out on a pier.
When i got to the end of the pier realized the dog was right behind me.
I could not swim.
The dog grabbed me by the thigh.
Other other adults came on the scene very very quickly and pulled me out.
Since then i have had a at least a small conditioned response to large dogs which growl and move toward you.
Shocks possibly upsets the owner who is glaring out the window thinking of retaliation.
Mother wisely presents an umbrella being more aware of rain to come.
Kid says.
On his way to school he gets wet.
Turns around comes home.
The good samaritan gets shafted again.
Man finds cat in tree.
Listens to the entreaties of the little girl who wants her cat back or or saved.
He accidentally to escape the dogs he accidentally drops the or kicks aside the ladder.
"Somebody has called police , fire or emergency services."
The firemen show up with another ladder.
The bird thinks it is hilarious.

I remember being at the hospital with my wife waiting.
We waited overnight.
We did not know whether the baby was going to be a boy or a girl.
So we were surprised when the baby was born.
And so then there i knew it was a girl and was pretty happy for a few days after that.
Well there is a man sitting in his living room relaxing.
It goes breaks the window.
The man looks out and is wondering where the ball came from and who did this.
So mother's saying to the boy probably that it is going to rain today.
You should take your umbrella with you to school.
So he the boy basically says.
No i do not need the umbrella.
He goes out.
It rains.
Then he runs back.
I told you so.
He leaves with the umbrella.
So for some reason a cat has climbed up a tree and is stuck.
"Then a man tries to come to the rescue , climbs up a ladder."
Somehow the ladder falls down.
He needs to be rescued.
So the fire department comes and i guess will try to rescue both of them.

Will you repeat the question?
So i guess one of the biggest impacts that was affected me was in nineteen eighty eight when my dad had a stroke.
It changed our whole family dynamics and business relationship.
You know it changed the way we were operating our business.
It forced us to do certain things.
So this ended up being where i had the ultimate medical responsibility for somebody who had had a stroke.
It turned out that it was eighteen years that it lasted.
The he is he lived for another eighteen years.
I sort of remember the story of cinderella.
Okay the little boy kicked the ball.
It went through the window right into the lap of the guy sitting in his living room.
The guy stood up and looked out and started yelling at the little kid.
So the mother wanted the little kid to take the the the umbrella to school.
The little kid did not take the umbrella.
He waved his mother goodbye.
He got outside.
It started to rain.
He was walking in the puddles.
He finally went home drenched to his mother.

Well i will start with yesterday.
Bebecause that is as far as my memory goes back.
Yesterday i went back to the bargains group where i worked for fifteen years.
I retired from them last august.
They brought in a parttime person.
I hadta help her with the year end process.
"I found out , which was rather interesting that when i do go back."
I like the retirement stage.
So i went there.
We thought we had our problem solved at about five fifteen and all of a sudden realized that we did not.
So i am going to have to go back again next week.
We are faced with a problem as far as time is concerned.
We hafta get done by a certain time.
It is a part of the work i just did not like doing.
Oh i will keep on going for two hours if you want.
Boy's kicking a soccer ball.
The ball happens to go through the window and actually land on somebody who is sitting in there.
The man gets up and looks out the window.
He says.
I do not want the umbrella.
He waves goodbye to his mother.
Then it starts to rain.

Do you want me to tell what happened?
Okay i was working in london england right as a teacher and in a very small school.
"I do not know , by hook or by crook , i got this invitation to go to a buckingham palace garden party with a whole pile of invitations to you know if you drive by car if you walk this the passes for all these places to go into."
So it was a big bunch of stuff i got in the mail.
So i went to my headmaster and told him that.
"He just immediately told all the teachers , which we were only like seven."
The other one just said.
Yeah the foreigners get to do those things.
"But we do not , we british."
"So this guy who was nasty like that , he did not talk to me for the rest of the year and a half i was there."
I do not know.
I did not do anything right?
So i think it was through canada house.
It go to england for instance to work or something you always register with canada house.
It was at trafalgar square you know.
Just you know to know that you are there.
If something happens to you you know they they have a trace on you.
Anyway so that what happens.
So i went.
It also said.
Well if it rains it is rained out and there is no second chance.
So of course thank goodness it did not rain.
It was very you know strict about you hadta wear a hat.
"I mean hat , gloves , stockings , heels , proper dress."
Did not matter you know if it was cold or warm.
I mean it hadta be proper dress.
So so we went there.
You know you go through the palace gates.
You go through buckingham palace itself.
You go down the steps.
Then there is this huge garden with ponds and flamingos in the ponds.
They had three tents.
You know like a wedding tent you would have three.
So and then there they were serving iced tea iced coffee and little biscuits and little sandwiches whatever it was.
So in there were little tables set up and everything very very nice.
Then there were different bands playing in different places.
I do not know if you have been but it is quite big.
Yeah and so at a certain time they said.
Okay now the royal party's coming.
So we all kind of got up.
There are walkways all along the the garden there.
So we we stood along the walkways.
"There comes you know the queen , philip , so many other royals."
I did not even know who they were at the time.
I did not really care that much.
Of course that was the time when the queen never ever shook hands with anybody.
"Bebecause you know he she does it three times a year , two in london and one in scotland."
So and then we went back to to having our coffee and our little sandwiches and stuff and little chitchat with whoever you know you happen to chitchat with.
I think by four of the clock four thirty they we started to leave.
It happened to be fabulous weather.
So that was a big big bonus you know.
Actually the headmaster told me.
Take the whole day off to get ready you know instead of just the afternoon.
Well next day i got back to school.
Everybody was super happy and curious what happened and everything except this guy who who just did not like it.
You know so she was a young woman.
"Oh okay it looks like the the boy is playing out in the garden , playing football."
I guess by mistake he is kicks the ball.
It goes through a window.
It goes through the window and lands through the window in the house and hits the lamp.
Beside the lamp there is a guy sitting in his armchair.
Yeah i do not know what happened to the lamp here.
So i guess it is time to maybe go to school in the morning.
The mother's mother's giving the umbrella to her child.
Oh i do not think the child gets the umbrella.
Anyway the third picture is it is starting to rain.
Now the kid has no umbrella.
So now he is getting wet.
So he is fourth picture he is running running back home i guess.
Mother gives the kid the umbrella.
So what do we have here?
Or the there is a cat on a branch.
I think the little girl wants the cat.
Meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree bebecause of course the dogs chase cats.
Meanwhile now they are getting the firemen there i guess to come and rescue the cat off from the tree there or maybe rescue the father.
I do not know.
"So there is this girl , cinderella."
She lives in a household with three stepsisters and a nasty stepmother.
An invitation comes from the palace for these three girls to go meet the prince or something.
They get all dolled up.
Poor cinderella hasta stay home and do the dirty work.
The the the three girls get to the ball.
Then the fairy godmother appears and said asks her if she wants to go.
"And the fairy godmother well gives her whatever , a beautiful gown and slippers and everything."
She says.
You got to be home by twelve of the clock.
So she gets to the ball.
The prince you know is there having a fabulous time.
One of her slippers falls off.
Meanwhile the prince has had an eye on her.
Anyway she hasta go.
So she went.
Then the prince says.
Well the you know i want to find the girl who has this glass slipper.
So the hunt goes out.
So they all go out and looking for the girl whose foot fits the slipper.
So they come to the house.
They try on.
But no it did not work.
Well there is cinderella still there you know.
Let her try it on.
Then of course the slipper fits her.
They live ever happily ever after.
I do not know.

We got into a big confrontation.
Bebecause i had a girlfriend.
I wanted to go.
So i went finally after struggling with my mother.
My father said.
Let him go.
Let him go.
I had a friend over.
Anyway we went to the dance and came out of the dance.
There was a big street in front of the dance.
Came out and i saw two people lying in the middle of the road.
They were obviously hit by a car.
No no ambulance or police had come yet.
There were no cars on the road.
So i went home.
There was a note on the door.
It said.
You know if i am not home go to the neighbor.
I went to the neighbor.
Right away i knew it was my parents in the middle of the road dying there.
My father died.
She survived.
You do not have to cry.
The boy's playing soccer.
He kicks the ball through the window.
The man's sitting there in the chair.
The ball breaks through the window.
The man gets the ball.
You know cannot see how.
But i assume he is pretty upset.
Well the mother's telling the little boy to take an umbrella to.
I assume he is going to school.
He has a backpack on.
Little boy does not want to take the umbrella.
It is raining out.
He gets all wet.
Then he comes home and to get the umbrella bebecause he realizes he made a mistake and should have taken the umbrella.
Well the the cat got up into the tree.
The father tries to get the cat.
But he seems to be stuck in the tree.
The dog is barking bebecause everyone everything's in chaos.
The firetruck comes with a ladder to try to get the cat and the father down from the tree.
Fairy godmother came and said.
Cinderella can go to the ball.
So she got these beautiful shoes and dress.
She had a coach with drawn by a horse.
Then she went to the ball.
But she hadta leave the ball by twelve of the clock.
So i think she was met the prince at the ball.
Then she left.
So the she left one slipper and had one slipper.
Then she got into the coach.
The horses turned into pumpkins.
Prince was going around looking for cinderella to find who fit the slipper.
He went to her house.
Then all the fat ugly stepsisters tried it on.
But it did not fit.
Finally cinderella fit and said.
Oh you have you know found my true love or something.

I was thinking about this today.
I thought generally speaking pretty well.
But i got a sort of mediocre to not so great mark in on the category of plays well with others.
I thought that was kind of unfair.
This boy was kicking the soccer ball around.
He neighbor's window and smashed it.
The neighbor was sitting in his living room as the soccer ball sort of emerged through the window.
The neighbor looked out with the ball in his hand accusingly at whoever kicked it.
The mother was just lecturing her son about the need to take an umbrella if he was going out.
The son reassured her that he did not need one.
Then it started to rain.
It started to rain even harder.
So he came home all wet.
The next time he went out he brought an umbrella.
Because of two emergencies the the fire department was called.
This the girl's cat ended up climbing a tree and was afraid to come back down.
In the same tree there was this man who climbed up it because he was being chased by a dog.
"Someone , probably the girl , brought a ladder."
But for whatever reason it did not reach either cat or the man.
So the fire department hadta come with a larger one.
Cinderella was an orphan girl who lived with her wicked stepmother and two wicked stepsisters even though she was prettier than e the stepsisters.
At one point the handsome prince arrived in the house.
The stepsisters wanted to go to the ball with him and so did the stepmother.
But cinderella made a wish.
She wished for a carriage.
But whoever granted her the wish said that at midnight the carriage would turn into a pumpkin.
So cinderella and the prince went to the ball.
But at one point the prince had a glass slipper.
There was some sort of prophecy that it would fit whoever he was destined to marry.
It turns out that it fits cinderella.
So somehow they got home before the carriage turned into a pumpkin.
They got married.

When i got married we decided that we were going to go to europe.
We took our car over on the boat.
You could really feel the water.
We landed in no rotterdam.
We drove all through europe for three months.
We ended up in le havre.
We came home and lived in our parents' basement because we had no more money.
A boy was playing soccer.
He kicked through the window.
The soccer bell landed on a man sitting in his chair.
He got up and looked out to see who kicked the soccer ball.
A boy who was going out to school.
His mother wanted him to take the umbrella.
He did not take the umbrella.
He went out.
He got wet.
"He got wetter and was running back , came back and stood there dripping while his mother looked at him."
He took the umbrella and continued on his way.
Mother knows best.
Okay let us see.
A cat went up a tree.
I guess a man tried to go up to get the cat.
A dog is barking on the tree and probably knocked over the ladder.
So the man could not get back down.
So the fire department is coming to the rescue.
Cinderella her father married another woman who had her own three daughters.
Cinderella hadta do all of the chores.
That is why she was called cinderella.
Because she was sweeping up the cinders from the fireplace.
There was a big ball coming with the prince going to be there.
Cinderella wanted to go of course.
But she could not because she had no clothes.
The fairy godmother came down and gave her a beautiful gown and some glass slippers and made into a coach.
There was footman and horses.
The footman was mice i think.
She went to the ball and had a wonderful time.
But she hadta leave by twelve of the clock.
As she left she dropped one of the glass slippers and came back home.
The prince got the slipper and then went around to find the woman whose foot fit into the slippers.
They lived happily ever after.
"No my granddaughter , she went to see cinderella and of course she hadta have the dress the tiara the thing and the shoes."
Yes we are paying off a second mortgage.

Okay so there is so many to choose from.
I just hafta try and fix my memory on one.
So i remember it was a day kind of like this but not so rainy.
I was tired because i would flown all night and everything.
But i decided i was going to go out sightseeing.
I did go out.
I went to the top of the peak in hong kong.
I looked around at the vista and saw the beautiful landscapes.
I remember saying.
Because that was the company i worked for at the time.
"So i felt a great deal of gratefulness and happiness , although i was tired and it was a bit drizzly , just to to be there."
"Okay jimmy's outside playing with the ball , kicking it around."
The ball breaks his neighbor's window.
The ball comes into the living room where the neighbor is sitting on the couch.
It broke a lamp and broke the window.
The neighbor grabs the ball.
Jimmy is got his backpack on.
He is going somewhere.
His mother says to take the umbrella.
But he does not seem to want to take the umbrella.
He says.
He does not need the umbrella.
He goes outside.
He goes outside.
No he did not take it.
He goes outside.
He gets all wet.
He comes home.
His mother looks like.
I told you so.
He takes the umbrella.
He goes outside.
So millie's cat has gone up into the tree.
Her dad has tried to rescue the cat.
But the ladder fell down.
The dog is barking because he does not know why his owner is not coming down.
The firemen come to rescue the dad.
So cinderella has a very pleasant existence with her father and mother.
The mother dies.
After some time the father remarries a woman who is a wicked stepmother and who comes to the marriage with two other daughters.
Cinderella is made to be a servant.
Then the prince is supposta find a bride.
All the women in the country are invited to come to the palace.

"She goes to the palace , meets the prince."
They fall in love.
The stroke of midnight everything goes back to what it started.
She escapes.
But one of her slippers stays behind.
The prince tries to find the woman whose foot fits the slipper.
Everybody tries to squeeze in but nobody can until it comes to cinderella.
Of course it fits.
They live happily ever after.
The bus is coming.
The tour bus is coming.
The tour bus is coming into the town.
The tour bus is coming into the town to pick up the people.
Tour bus is coming into town to pick up people from hotel.
The tour bus is coming into the town to pick up the people from the hotel to go swimming.
The dog chased the cat up the tree.
The bird was caught by the worm.
Would you like to star in a movie?
Books like to read children.
Icecream tastes good in the summer.
Beautiful flowers smelled the lovely woman.
The man saw the boy that the dog chased.
The tiger was clawed by the lion.
Bad weather was caused by long airplane delays.
One thing i recall i was extremely frightened when my thirteen year old son ran a huge hook into his hand and hadta be rushed into emergency.
Then it was so painful for him to have this big hook.
I took him to the hospital with the hook in his hand because we were afraid to pull it out.
We might do further damage.
So he was sent to the hand group at jewish hospital.
They hadta open his hand and remove it because this hook had left a rusty path.
But it was very fortunate that it sort of pushed everything out of the way as it entered his hand because otherwise they were afraid that he was going to have bone and tendon damage.
But he healed fine.
There were no bad side effects from it.
There is a young lady who apparently has fallen into the water.
But maybe she was white water rafting because this other person has on a life preserver.
He is trying to save her.
He is holding on to a tree.
I imagine that she is farther down.
I cannot see her hands.
But they are both hanging on for dear life.
Johnny plays soccer with the the school team.
So he is out on his front lawn practicing one day kicking the soccer ball around.
Oops unfortunately it hits the window and smashes through going into the house where his daddy is sitting.
The ball knocks the lamp over.
The daddy is registering shock.
Then he jumps up and gets the ball.
He looks out.
He does not see his son.
I think his son ran away and is hiding somewhere.
He has a backpack.
His mother is telling him that it is going to rain and he should carry an umbrella.
But he says.
No no i do not want to carry an umbrella.
So he leaves without it.
He tells her goodbye and leaves without the umbrella.
He has not gone very far when it actually starts raining.
Then it gets harder and harder and harder.
He gets very wet.
He is splashing in the puddles.
So he runs home.
So then he dries off.
This time he goes back out with the umbrella.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella.
Her mother passed away.
Then eventually her father married again.
He did not realize that the woman he married was so wicked.
But then the father passed away and so cinderella was left to the wicked stepmother.
She had two ugly daughters.
So then the prince of this little town became of age where the father the king wanted him to marry.
So he announced had his man one of his servants announce that there would be a a ball.
All of the young ladies who were eligible to marry the prince were invited to the ball.
She made herself a lovely dress to wear.
So then when the two stepsisters saw how pretty she was and her dress was so pretty they tore it all to pieces.
So she had nothing to wear to the ball and her stepmother told her that she hadta go stay in her room.
She was crying and crying.
Her her fairy godmother showed up and wanted asked her what was wrong.
She said well she wanted to go to the ball but she did not have anything to wear.
So the fairy godmother just waves her wand.
Boom cinderella just appears in this beautiful dress.
Then the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a beautiful coach.
Away they go in the carriage.
Cinderella traveled in the carriage to the ball.
When she entered she was so beautiful.
The prince was just really taken with her and he danced with her all evening.
But the fairy godmother had warned her that she hadta be home before the stroke of midnight because at that point everything would return the way it was.
But she had given her some lovely glass slippers to wear.
So then she at they were dancing.
At twelve of the clock the she when she heard the clock strike twelve she ran because she knew she hadta get out of there really fast.
On the way she lost one of her glass slippers.
The prince chased after her but then he lost sight of her.
But he found the slipper and carried kept it with him.
Then the he just pined away because he lost this lovely lady and who he had really fallen in love with and wanted to make his wife.
So the king ordered one of his servants to take the glass slipper around the village and have the maidens try it.
When it was a perfect fit he knew that he had found the one that the prince had fallen in love with.
So when he went to the home of the ugly stepsisters they tried to force their big foot into the slipper.
It just would not work.
So they said.
The wicked stepmother said.
Her foot just went into it perfectly.
So the knew they had found the right person.
So she and the prince were married and lived happily ever after.
So i guess she gets her daddy to go climb the tree to go get the cat.
Meanwhile the dog is barking like crazy.
Bebecause he is all excited about what is going on.
Then the firemen are coming with the ladder to get the man and the cat down because apparently neither one of them can get down from the tree.
Oh i think that there probably was a ladder at the tree that the man climbed up on.
Maybe the dog knocked it down because the ladder's down.
So he needed help from the fire department and from the firemen.
Well you take two slices of bread.
You need a knife.
Then you get a jar of jelly.
Then you spread the jelly on the other slice of bread.
Then you put the two together.
Okay now she the little girl lost the.
A kitty cat went up into the tree and could not get down.
So the father he went up in the tree to retrieve the kitty cat.
But while he was up there a dog came and growled and kept him up in the tree.
So that someone hadta call the fire department.
The fire department came with a ladder.
They removed the dog.
You first well hafta get out the peanut butter and the jelly.
So if it is open you would hafta remove the cover from the jelly.
If it is fresh peanut butter it it is it it will open.
You just hafta snap open the the lid.
You take a knife.
You would place some peanut butter on bread.
You would hafta select the kind of bread you want to use.
That is the way i do it.
You could put it on top of the other slice of bread if you wanted to.
Then you would put the slices together.
Wrap it up if you are going to carry it.
Or if you are going to eat it there put it on a plate.
Well i guess it was pretty important i was in pilot training.
I was one of the ones selected to be washed out.
I could not figure out why i was washed out in that i was as smart as you know i as the people around me.
But they really discovered that i could not pay attention.
The disc would go around.
You hadta hadta keep the electrode on top of that disc.
I know i did not do well in that because i i was not a good concentrator.
I mean i remember him listening to the radio to jack armstrong.
You know the whole house would be falling down.
He he would not come.
But he would not come to dinner when he was listening to the radio.
When they called me for dinner i was always there.
So i guess that is all the stories i have.
Then am i going to tell you about the pictures?
Okay the boy is playing ball.
He kicks a ball through the window.
It breaks the window.
Oh it tips over a lamp on the inside.
I have i have done this.
We have we have had this happen a lot of times in my family so we are familiar.
People have replaced the window themselves and charged us for it.
We have run away from it.
Well i i know now i would not run away.
He says no he does not want to take it because he does not want to be bothered carrying the umbrella.
Then he starts walking down.
He walks a ways.
He finds that it is raining.
So he goes back and gets the umbrella from her.
But he ends up taking the umbrella and walking in the rain with the umbrella.
Well this looks like a lifeboat or a rescue operation.
This man looks like he was in some fire service or something like that.
He is rescued this lady who was well in swirling current.
She is going to be calm enough now where he could rescue her.
So i guess that is just branches.
They he is going to try to get her to closer to some safety where she could be rescued or you know.
She is sent to work in this castle.
Her three three daughters want to go to the ball.
The prince hasta he has a slipper.
He is trying to find out who the slipper fits.
He is going to take to the ball whoever the slipper fits.
Now the the the daughters try it but they try to force it on.
Even if they force it on themselves they still cannot really fit the slipper very well.
So the slipper fits on cinderella.
But the thing is at twelve of the clock if she is not home she will change back to a pumpkin.
Or yeah let us let us go like that.
She is changed into a pumpkin.
So they go to the ball.
The the they they three of them go to the ball.
Cinderella goes to the ball.
She they they are leaving just around twelve of the clock.
I guess the prince knows that cinderella is the one who wore the slipper.
So he he marries cinderella.
Everything ends up happily ever after.
A dog has chased a cat up a tree.
The dog is still barking at the tree so the cat will not come down.
"So daddy goes up, takes a ladder and goes up into the tree."
Of course the ladder falls.
The dog is barking at the tree.
Daddy's sitting in the tree.
The little girl is still crying.
The firemen come with their ladder to get them down.
You get out the peanut butter and a knife.
You spread as much peanut butter as you want on that one piece of bread.
You get out the jelly and a knife.
You spread the other piece of bread.
Then you put them together.
You have got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Nineteen years ago actually my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
A few months before the diagnosis he would had triple bypass surgery.
Had a hard time recovering from it.
But he was coming along and getting better.
Then he acted funny.
He just did not act right.
I thought maybe he would had a stroke.
So we went to the emergency room and they did xrays and this that and the other thing.
They also thought he would had a stroke.
So he they put him in the hospital and gave him medication.
One of the medications they gave him was prednisone which is a steroid.
He got better right now with that.
That worried the doctors because with a stroke you do not get better with prednisone like that.
So they looked further and found a tumor in his brain.
He went down.
He lived for almost a year.
I thought the pain i was feeling then was the worst pain i could have knowing that he was dying.
But when he died the pain was ten times as bad.
If it had not been for hospice of the bluegrass and their bereavement program i do not know that i would have made it.
When you lose someone like that you hafta do your grief work.
You cannot go around it over it under it.
You have got to go through it.
If you do not do your grief work you are ruined for the rest of your life.
I hafta thank hospice for getting me through it.
They did a beautiful job.
There was a little boy playing with a soccer ball.
He was kicking it around and enjoying himself.
All of a sudden the ball went through a window of someone is house.
The ball hit a lamp next to a man sitting in a chair.
He got out of the chair and held the ball and looked out the window to see who had done this.
There is a mother and a little boy.
The little boy's getting ready to go to school.
He is got his backpack on and he is all ready to go to school.
His mother is trying to make him take an umbrella with him because it is going to rain.
He will not do it.
He says goodbye and leaves.
Mother's still holding the umbrella.
He gets a few blocks maybe from home.
It starts to rain.
Then it pours rain.
He runs home.
He is sopping soaking wet.
"But she dries him off, makes him change his clothes, hands him an umbrella, and sends him off again."
There was apparently a flash flood.
The woman got caught in this flash flood either walking or driving.
She was up to her neck in water hanging on to a tree limb when i would assume a fireman with a life jacket on came into the water.
He was also holding onto the tree and trying to rescue her.
Her father married a nasty woman who had two nasty girls.
They treated her like dirt.
They made her do all the work in the house.
The prince of the area was planning a ball.
Everybody all he was looking for a wife.
All of the young ladies in the area were invited to come to the ball.
The wicked stepmother would not let cinderella go.
All the animals and the birds and and so on loved cinderella.
They got together.
Tried to make her feel better.
Made her a pretty dress to wear.
But she still could not go to the ball until her fairy godmother appeared and waved a wand over her and made her beautiful and in in a gorgeous dress and glass slippers.
She made her a carriage out of a pumpkin.
Cinderella rode to the ball.
But she was told she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight.
So she went to the ball and her stepmother and her wicked stepsisters were very upset that she was there.
She danced with the prince.
Then he fell in love with her.
When the clock struck midnight she ran down the stairs so that she could get away when she was sposta.
The prince sent a man from house to house to try the slipper on every girl's foot.
The wicked stepmother when they he came to their house tried to cram her daughters' feet into the glass slipper.
Of course they did not fit.
Not going to let cinderella try the slipper but the man insisted.
So cinderella tried the slipper.
Of course it fit.
The prince came and claimed her.
Jelly sandwich i will explain it to you.
First of all you need two slices of bread.
With a knife you take peanut butter out of the peanut butter jar and spread it on one side of one of the bread slices.
Then with your knife you take jelly out of the jelly jar and spread it on the other slice of bread.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
There appears to be a cat who has run up a tree.
The dog probably frightened the cat up into the tree.
The little girl is crying for her cat.
Her father has taken a ladder and tried to climb the tree to get the cat.
However the ladder fell.
The dad is marooned up in the tree on a branch.
Someone has called the firemen to come with their ladder to get the father and the cat down from the tree.
When i graduated from college undergraduate school i went to seattle to visit my sister.
I stayed on there because the welfare department was hiring.
So i hired on as a social worker.
During the first week the welfare department hired many social workers.
I met another woman who was hired at the same time i was.
We became friends and got an apartment together.
She introduced me to a man who had gone to the same school as she had gone to in michigan.
That gentleman and i fell in love.
We married.
The sister that i had gone to visit in seattle was my maid of honor.
We stayed in washington.
My husband was teaching at port orchard which was just across the bay from seattle.
We lived there for the first year until we moved back to seattle.
That was how i met and married my husband.
The young boy appears to be practicing soccer because he is kicking a soccer ball which i assume accidentally goes into a window and breaks the window.
There is a gentleman sitting in the living room next to the window.
The ball comes through the broken window and knocks over the lamp.
The man picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window to see if he can tell where the soccer ball came from.
A little boy is leaving the house.
His mother tries to get him to take an umbrella with him.
When he opens the door it is not raining.
So he talks her out of giving him the umbrella.
But when he gets out and is walking away from the house it begins to rain.
So he turns around runs back to the house and comes back in the house soaking wet and dripping.
His mother is very angry because he did not take the umbrella with him and she frowns at him.
But then he decides it is alright to take the umbrella.
Out he goes with the umbrella to prevent the rain from making him wet.
There is a young girl in the flood waters probably a river.
But there is a man with a life jacket on him who is trying to rescue her.
He is grasping a branch of a tree that overhangs the water.
He is going to rescue her.
He has a belt to put around her and save her from the flood waters.
Cinderella's father brings into his home and cinderella's home a woman and her two ugly daughters.
She becomes stepmother to cinderella.
She favors her own daughters over cinderella.
As they are living together they find out that the king is going to give a ball for the prince.
Cinderella looks through a trunk finding some clothing.
But she is not allowed to go to the ball.
So the other two ugly stepdaughters dress up in the pretty clothes that they find.
Cinderella needs to go out to the stable to take care of the animals and of course do all the other work around the house.
Cinderella is very disappointed because she will not be allowed to go to the ball.
But the other stepdaughters do.
While they are gone the fairy godmother and all the mice come in to talk to cinderella and the fairy godmother of course dresses her in finery and changes the pumpkin into a fancy coach.
Cinderella goes to the ball and dances with the prince.
But when the clock strikes twelve cinderella hasta rush out and down the palace steps to go away from the ball.
The men who work for the king then take the glass slipper that cinderella had lost on this her flight out of the palace to see who it will fit.
When they come to cinderella's house it fits cinderella.
It seems that a cat has climbed up in a tree.
The father or the man of the family has climbed up the tree to rescue the cat.
As he got to the first limb on the tree to go out to get the cat the ladder fell down.
Now the father is stranded along with the kitty cat.
The dog is barking and making a lot of noise.
Someone has called the fire department.
They have a brought a ladder to come rescue the father and we hope the cat.
There is a bird singing in the tree because he does not have any problems.
We have a favorite bread that comes from kroger.
It is called oatmeal bread.
I take two slices and put them on a plate.
Then i get smucker's regular creamy peanut butter out and knife on a whole bunch of it.
As much as the bread will hold because we love it.
Then i hafta get sugar free preserves.
Put spread the preserves all over the other slice of the bread.
The most important event that comes to mind right now is the fact that i got married in october of o seven.
I had known the lady named sharon lastname for thirty something years.
I trained her first husband as an equipment salesman for central school supply company.
I called her came to lexington to visit.
Lo and behold we began a relationship.
Which lasted for some seventeen.
It worked out very well because my children had known her forever.
They all loved her.
In december of o six for christmas i gave her an engagement ring which surprised her and astounded me.
But we proceeded to be engaged for about ten months.
On october the twenty eighth two thousand seven what i thought was going to be a small intimate wedding at saint michael's church turned into a grand gala affair with a couple of hundred people and a reception that was real real well done.
A lot of friends from louisville came.
A lot of sharon's friends came.
We just had a grand time.
Two of our very favorite people who are episcopal priests jay pierce and joyce bullou married us.
A good many friends at our church helped in the ceremony.
The young man is practicing with his soccer ball.
He gives it a good boot.
Bang it goes through the window of a house.
It sharply awakens a fella sitting in a chair where the glass breaks and the ball comes through.
The last frame shows the fella looking out the break in the window holding the ball and wondering the heck happened.
Who can he blame for it?
Okay here a mother is offering her child i guess a little boy an umbrella.
The little boy is saying.
No i do not need that.
I will just go out the front door and be fine.
Well the mother keeps the umbrella.
The little boy goes outside.
It begins to rain.
Now it is raining harder and blowing a little.
So he goes back inside very soaked.
His mother looks at him like she is not real happy with him.
But the last frame shows him walking with the umbrella and keeping the rain off.
Okay we have a picture of raging water which indicates that probably the beginning of the story was a rainstorm of some type.
A young lady appears to have been trapped in the raging waters.
Someone of an emergency nature fireman or someone official he has a vest on has come to rescue her.
She is hanging on the branch.
He has wrapped a belt around her her safe.
Cinderella and two girls who did not like her.
Evidently the evil girls' mother did not like her either.
There was going to be a ball.
They the sisters could go but cinderella could not.
Then out of nowhere came a fairy godmother who gave her a beautiful dress.
Lo and behold she got to go to the ball.
Her dog as i recall was very happy about it.
But then at the ball there is a a handsome prince.
They dance.
All of a sudden she is sitting on a pumpkin in a tree i know not why with one glass slipper.
Then the mice help her find her way back home i think.
All of a sudden the prince shows up.
He has the other glass slipper.
They live happily ever after.
This little girl's cat saw a bird up in the tree.
Wanted climbed up the tree to get the bird.
Got stuck as cats frequently do and could not come down.
So the little girl who had been riding her tricycle called for her father who came.
He put a ladder up.
About that time the dog came.
The little girl was starting to cry.
How they got the fire department i do not know.
But here they come to get the daddy down out of the tree.
So they are they were going to get the daddy out of the tree.
The bird would fly away.
I can do that.
First you get your bread.
Then you get your peanut butter.
Then you get your jelly.
You take the bread out of the package.
I spread mine on both pieces of bread with peanut butter.
One piece gets jelly.
The top goes on.
I have had a very very active life.
I already told you i was an actress.
That was not what i started out to be at all.
But they gave me a screen test when my mother and i went to california for my sister's wedding.
The suggestion was made that i have a screen test which i did.
When i came back and started my sophomore year in high school they called and said they wanted me to come back.
The interesting thing was making the movie was very interesting work.
I met lots of stars.
I hadta take lessons.
I hadta go to school bebecause i was fifteen.
But also i hadta take singing lessons.
I hadta take dancing lessons.
They wanted me to get rid of my southern accent as quickly as possible.
Which i think i did pretty well in those days.
It is all come back.
But i i thoroughly enjoyed it.
What i did not like and what eventually caused me to leave my contract was the control.
They controlled your life.
You could go where they said.
You could do what they said.
But you did not have the freedom to just come and go as you pleased.
They had interviews planned and planned photo sessions planned and introductions planned and this sort of thing.
That rankled with me.
I mean all my life i had done what i wanted to do pretty much.
My sister who had married lived in palm springs which was a a base for air transport to the war zones.
I went down to visit her several times and met a man.
How much more of my life do you want to hear?
Well there is a young boy.
He is kicking a soccer ball.
It predictably goes through the window.
His father gets up out of the chair carrying the ball.
Okay a little boy is getting ready to go to school or wherever.
School i think.
He has a backpack on.
His mother offers him an umbrella.
He waves it off.
I do not need an umbrella.
Then he gets out.
It starts to rain.
He turns around and runs back home.
His mother looks at him like.
See i told you so.
He looks totally wet.
Then he starts off again only this time he has an umbrella.
How she got there i do not know.
The man has all the life saving equipment on hi am.
He is got a lifejacket and a belt that holds his tools that he needs.
She is holding onto a limb.
He is he is holding onto the limb.
At any rate he is in the water as far as i can see in order to save her.
She looks distressed.
He looks purposeful.
As far as the end is concerned i do not know whether he got her to shore or not.
He is getting ready to marry a woman who will be cinderella's stepmother.
She already has two daughters.
So he introduces them.
The stepmother looks at cinderella like she was a bad dream or something.
At any rate you could tell from her face that she was not going to be a very kind stepmother.
So right away she puts cinderella to work waiting on everybody and doing everything.
In the book that i knew when i was a child she cleaned out cinders from the fireplace.
But they do not do that anymore.
But she waited on everybody.
There is a picture in that book that looks as if maybe it is the king ranting and raving because his son needs to have a wife.
So they have a ball.
The two stepdaughters get all dressed up and get ready to go.
Cinderella is not going to be allowed to go.
While everything is going on the ball and everything there is a little cute little plump lady who turns out to be the fairy godmother.
She will find a dress that she can wear and go to the ball.
So cinderella goes up in the attic.
She gets the dress.
This fairy godmother makes a coach out of a pumpkin.
She makes horses out of mice.
The prince who is very handsome sees her.
The fairy godmother tells her she must be home by midnight.
So when it gets close to midnight she rushes.
As she rushes down the steps she one of her glass slippers falls off.
The i do not know what you would call him equerry i guess he is brings the shoe and gives it to the prince.
The prince sends out a little fat man with a pillow all over to try on this shoe.
The stepmother is sitting there thinking for sure her daughter's are going to fit the slipper.
But they do not.
Suddenly the guy says.
Well we have not tried cinderella yet this young lady.
The stepmother looks horrified that cinderella would even be considered.
But they try the slipper on her foot.
It fits perfectly.
That is the one that the prince is looking for.
So she goes.
They live happily ever after.
Well the little girl was playing in the yard and with the cat and the dog.
She had her tricycle.
It looks like the cat climbed up the tree and got stuck there.
So she called her dad to come and get the cat out of the tree.
"Well dad got a ladder, climbed up the tree, and then somehow perhaps the dog perhaps the wind blew the ladder over."
So now dad is stuck in the tree.
The cat is stuck in the tree.
The little girl is shouting.
The dog is barking up the tree.
Somebody had the presence of mind to call the fire department and now the fire department is on the way with a ladder to get daddy and the kitty out of the tree.
"Okay to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you clearly need bread, peanut butter, and jelly."
So you get out if you are going to make one probably two slices of bread.
Then sit down and enjoy it and hope you do not get salmonella.
Well i am going to tell you about having a grandson.
Because that is probably the most important thing that is happened in recent recent years.
We waited very long.
My mother has a cousin.
I should go back and say my mother has a cousin who at the age of seventy had her first and only grandchild.
This happened about fifteen years ago.
I remember saying to my husband at the time can you imagine being seventy years old and not having a grandson?
Well my first son got married and after a year or two they told us they were not planning to have any children.
Then my second son got married and we waited and we waited and we waited.
I had kind of given up hope when they called one night and said.
Well the last time one of my sons had asked to put dad on the phone it was to tell us that he was getting divorced.
So dad got on the phone.
Now my son said.
Now there are five of us on the phone.
I said.
Well he said.
It still did not penetrate.
I said.
So they told us they were having a baby.
The baby was born seven months later.
Practicing his kicks i guess.
He gets a really good kick going because he knocks it right through the window of the house.
Man is sitting inside the house.
The ball comes in the window knocks over a lamp.
Then the man stands there and looks out the window looking kind of surprised.
I cannot quite figure out if that is a dust buster he is holding in his other hand or getting ready to clean up the mess.
I cannot really tell.
Little boy is getting ready to go to school.
Mom hands him an umbrella says.
You are going to needta this.
It is going to rain.
They go to the front door.
He says.
Look it is not raining.
I do not need the umbrella.
Gets not too far from the house and lo and behold it starts raining and he starts getting wet.
He runs back home.
Mom looks a little ticked off at him.
He is looking a little dismayed.
"Well i it it appears to me that these people were in some kind of a boat on a body of water because the man is wearing a vest, a life vest."
The girl however does not appear to be.
So apparently there there were some rapids or something and for some reason the they were thrown out of the boat.
"Boat overturned, do not know."
They are thrown out of the water.
They are now being swept down this waterway.
The man grabs onto a branch that is hanging over the water.
The girl comes by and he tries to get her to you know hang on also so that she does not get swept any further away.
Once upon a time in a land far away a man lived with his pretty young daughter.
His wife had died.
One day he met a woman and decided that he would marry her.
She had two daughters of her own.
She did not look like a very pleasant person but he was besotted and he married her.
So they all came to live together.
Unfortunately his daughter cinderella was treated rather shabbily by the stepmother and the stepsisters.
Made to do all the housework and her made to you know take care of everything.
And and so she was living a rather miserable existence.
In the meantime in the castle in the distance lived a king who wanted his son to get married.
He said.
Okay it is time you needta find a wife.
They sent out invitations all over the land for people to come to the ball.
Of course the the stepmother got the invitation and was simply thrilled.
Surely one of them was going to get to marry the prince.
They got all this finery.
Night of the ball came.
Cinderella put on a pretty dress that the mice had somehow arranged for her.
They told her.
No you cannot go.
You stay home.
So they went off to the ball.
Cinderella was rather dejected.
She went out in the garden and and there was a fairy godmother.
She said.
Cinderella said.
Well i want to go to the ball.
I cannot go to the ball.
The fairy godmother said.
I will arrange for you to go to the ball.
She waved her magic wand and dressed her into a beautiful ball gown.
She waved it again.
The pumpkin turned into a coach and the mice became the horses to carry her to the ball and possibly a footman.
So she went to the ball.
The prince was smitten with her and danced with her.
Oh and the fairy godmother had told her she hadta be home by midnight.
So now she is dancing with the prince.
She hears the clock start to strike.
So she realizes she hasta leave.
Oh one of the pieces of finery the fairy godmother provided was a pair of glass slippers.
So she runs away from the prince.
In the course of running down the steps steps out of one of her glass slippers.
Now the prince is left with only a glass slipper and a memory of this gorgeous young woman.
He decides to go throughout the land and try to find her.
Whoever will fit in the slipper will be his bride.
So he goes around.
He gets to the house where cinderella lives.
The wicked stepsisters cannot fit in the shoe.
Of course the shoe fits cinderella.
So he is found his princess.
They get married and live happily ever after.
Okay i have been asked to talk about making a peanut butter and and jelly sandwich.
I personally like regular whole wheat bread.
So i would get two slices of bread.
My wife insists on using a spoon to get the jelly out of there but i do not use it.
But i would take and spread the peanut butter on the one piece of bread.
We have a real pickle here.
Looks like the family cat has been chased up the tree by their dog.
The father has gone to rescue the cat.
His daughter is just crying wanting the cat to come down.
The father gets up on the limb of the tree.
The step ladder falls down.
Somebody must have called.
There is a bird watching it all.
But somebody must have called the fire department.
Here they come a running ladder.
I guess one of the nicest things or greatest things that ever happened was i was single.
My first wife had passed away.
I had left ashland.
I came in to see my dad.
"I stopped at the filling station, large one, speedway."
I said.
I said.
She says.
I says.
Oh you are doing some shopping?
She says.
She says.
I met the lady that runs that place and she wanted to know about you.
I said.
I said.
I says.
I said.
I says.
Well i guess i will get stop over and see ththem.
I said.
What did you say the lady's last name was?
Well i went into a men's store that i am good friends with.
I walked in and i said.
I said.
Do you have a city directory?
She said.
She says.
I says.
She says.
Who you looking for?
I said.
I says.
Just let me look.
Well i looked under the business part.
I says.
Who you talking about?
Well i told her.
She says.
I do not think she is married dave.
I says.
Well it says so in the book.
Said anyway i said.
I was thought.
Well at least she expressed an interest in me.
So i thought well maybe i oughta look into this.
Well i go over to see the girls anyway.
So i went over and saw the girls to their delight.
I was waving.
I heard the darnedest commotion.
I said.
I says.
City directory says you are married.
She had a hard time convincing me of that.
Well anyway things progressed.
We had a very short courtship.
The funniest part was she would come up to.
I was living about thirty five miles north of ashland in a small community on a lake.
She came up.
She would go to church with me on sundays and then after mass we would get together with four or five of the couples and the priest and go to the local joint and have dinner and this and that.
This got to be kind of a habit.
She would drive up every sunday.
Then we would greet go back lake and read the paper or whatever.
Finally i proposed.
I mean she encouraged me.
So we decided.
Now we had not even known each other more than five weeks.
I said.
Well let us take a ride and we will go someplace nice and eat.
Well we came down.
We ended up at nashville.
We went all over the place and nothing was open.
We stopped at a little town in across the river from maysville called aberdina the truck stop.
It sort of started getting dark.
She hadta drive back to ashland.
I says.
You better get going.
She says.
Not til i call my mother.
I says.
What you going to do that for?
Well i am going to tell her we are engaged.
I says.
She says.
So she called her mother and she hands me the phone.
I says.
What you want me to do?
Well her dad comes on the phone and i introduce myself.
Then i said.
He is yelling and both of them are hard of hearing.
I could hear.
"She run over to the phone, picked it up, and she says."
I says.
Yeah i sure did.
We both had a big laugh over that.
Start of a great marriage that is still going on.
What we have story of a boy kicking the soccer ball having a good time.
Number picture number two that ball gets errantly kicked.
It goes through a picture window.
Lands in the lap of the man of the house who is reading the newspaper.
Here we have a mother and a child with an umbrella.
The mother's holding the umbrella.
The mother is trying to get the child to take the umbrella and the boy it is saying.
"No, nope, i am not going to take it."
Which upsets the mother but she does does not get her way.
So the boy takes off.
It starts dripping.
Then it gets harder.
It starts raining more.
It starts raining more.
He goes back home.
He is soaking wet.
He is got a down looked face.
Then it ends with him walking back towards school with an umbrella.
This looks like a fireman or a man in the rescue system.
Has jumped into a swirling sort of a creek trying to pull out a little girl and who is hanging on to this limb.
Saving the little girl raging waters of this swelled creek due to the rains that have come.
She is sent off to another home with a woman and two daughters who are not very welcoming at all.
She they make a servant out of cinderella.
"She waits on the the daughters and the mother hand and foot cleaning, picking up after ththem trying to take care of the cat which has little thorhorns on it."
The cat does not like it at all.
Well cinderella there is the annual ball coming up at the castle.
The king has raised holy cain with his son about finding a wife.
He decides to throw this ball to get him introduced to the young ladies or the young ladies in the community introduced to him.
Well she looks across the roof tops to the castle.
She is wishes she could go but she cannot.
They do not want her to do anything.
How they are going to look and how they are going to dress and what they are going to put on and this and that.
They squabble and bicker and fight among themselves.
In the meantime cinderella looks at the one of the gowns that the girls are going to try and thing.
Well there is about four mice that enter the picture about this time who are friends with cinderella and realize her predicament.
By golly they go to the fairy godmother.
And and they take cinderella there.
Cinderella tells her the story.
She says.
We will take care of it.
The next picture we see is cinderella all dressed in a beautiful white gown with silver slippers.
But there is nothing they can do.
Because the mice and the fairy godmother is not going to let anything upset their her plans or cinderella is going to have a good time.
They even have a carriage come and take cinderella to the ball in the carriage with a driver.
Well it shows that cinderella meets the prince.
She and the prince hit it off just great.
But there was a stipulation.
There was a very big stipulation that cinderella hadta be gone by the time that the stroke of midnight.
"That the carriage would not be there, that she would lose her gown, and her she would be dressed in her ordinary just plain dowdy clothes."
Well she gets out of the castle.
She just gets away from the prince.
The stroke of midnight comes.
She looks at herself and she is rather in her servant's clothing.
Well one of the good things about this is is the slipper had fallen off her foot.
Somebody had retrieved it and taken it to the prince.
The prince sent out people all over the kingdom to find the person that that shoe fitted.
That one of the searchers came and knocked at this door that cinderella was staying at.
He tries the shoe on the two daughters and.
Yes we have a servant here cinderella.
But that one shoe would not fit her.
Of course they know that the shoe does bebecause they had seen her wearing it.
That would not fit her.
He says.
Well i must insist.
The prince has told me that i must try every foot in the kingdom.
Sure enough he tries her shoe shoe on the foot.
There is joy in kingdomdom.
The prince has found his mate chosen one and all ends in love and happiness.
Okay a a little girl on a tricycle is trying to get her cat out of the tree.
There is also a man in the tree who got away from a dog bite him.
In meantime the fire department is coming with a ladder to help the cat out of the tree and presumably help the man out of the tree.
You take two slices of bread.
Then you spread the jelly.
Then you put the other half of the bread on.
She had gone to the doctor.
He he said there was nothing wrong with her.
So her surgeon sent her to the cleveland clinic.
She spent seven days there.
They work in a group of five doctors.
The day she left the doctor sat on the bed and said.
I can assure you nothing is organically wrong.
The little boy is playing with his ball.
He kicks it.
It goes through the window where a man is sitting.
So the window is broken while he is looking at the outside trying to figure out what happened.
He has the ball.
He is looking for the boy.
Okay the mother wants the boy to take the umbrella when he goes out.
He does not want to take it.
So he gets caught in the rain.
He gets back home and his mother is scolding him.
So the next time he goes out he takes the umbrella with him.
He is holding onto a branch to keep from drowning.
She is also holding on so so she will not drown.
She finds a magic shoe.
But well she has a deadline.
If she does not get home by a certain time.
But i think she gets back in time.
She marries the prince.
What do you want to know?
What i see?
Well there is a little girl on the ground with her cat's got up into a tree.
Her dad got up in the tree to try get the cat.
The ladder fell over.
There is a bird over there singing.
Bebecause that is what the cat went after i assume.
There is a dog scratching on the tree and barking.
A fire engine and two firemen coming over with a ladder to get him down.
She is got a tricycle there in front of her.
Well first you take the bread.
Then you get the jelly.
Then you get the peanut butter.
You spread the peanut butter on the bread.
I guess i have lost maybe a hundred thousand dollars.
But as long as you do not sell nothing you have not lost it if you understand what i am saying.
As an example i have got a lot of proctor and gamble.
But now the i guess that is the way these agents you know make their money by talking the public into relinquishing what they have got as that is good.
Now i do not say you should keep all your stocks.
But you give ththem a blue chip you know.
Then i mean i am really surprised with the people selling the automotive shares.
Matter of fact just last friday i went out and bought a thousand shares of ford.
Also i bought a thousand shares of a k steel.
Being retired i can watch a lot of television as i have said earlier.
I watch all the news programs especially on a sunday when you get a lot of diversified you know opinions.
They were seventy four dollars a share and now i put a bid in for six dollars a share.
Bebecause it was was five seventy six when i started playing phone tag with the broker.
So like i said last friday i went to fifth third met a broker there and we put in a buy for it.
Now if you do not understand what a buy means it was selling for six twenty one.
Well i said.
When it goes down to six buy me a thousand shares of it.
My reason for doing that is obama wants to improve improve all the infrastructure.
Okay infrastructure means steel.
That is where a k steel comes in.
Although they have not completed you know through congress what they wanted to do but they are trying to say buy american.
I really do not believe in that.
But that is really going to push the american steel up.
All amercian industries are going to start making recovers.
But it was funny i just listened this morning on television before i would come down here.
The state of kentucky is making it illegal to buy any american flag that is not made in the united states.
They are trying to pass that right now.
So that is leave it to me that was the most interesting thing to me.
The the worst thing was losing all that money at my age.
Course i do not hafta sell anything and i am not going to sell it.
But hopefully by then if i live that long it will go back up again.
Okay a little boy out there playing soccer i suppose it is.
He kicks it up and it goes through a guy's window.
He is sitting there in the chair.
It breaks that window.
The man has the ball by the broken window.
He is standing at the window looking out.
Okay little boy's getting ready to go out and his mom brought an a umbrella for him.
Well he kept telling.
No mom i do not need the umbrella.
It was not raining then.
Soon as he gets outside it starts pouring down rain on him.
So he is running along trying to get keep dry so he goes back to the house.
His mom scolds him for not taking it with him.
Then he gets the umbrella from his mother.
He proceeds on to school.
I assume that is where he is going.
He is got pack on.
Well there is evidently a woman got out in the stream in a flood.
She hung up on a tree limb about ready to drown.
Then a rescue worker comes out there and gets a hold of her.
He is trying to put the looks like a strap or a belt that is affixed to himself.
Again around her and he is going to take her in i guess.
Cinderella was evidently a servant to this uppity family which had a couple of daughters.
The daughters were invited to a big banquet or ball.
Cinderella was not shocked but she knew she was not on the same level.
Social level so she did not get to go.
So then after they had left she was dreaming.
Okay and in her dreams somehow she got a nice dress.
They a team came by to get her.
A team of horses with a pumpkin was what the carriage looked like.
So she went to the ball.
She got to the ball and everybody was excited bebecause she was there nervous or something.
So she meets the prince.
Her and the prince were dancing.
Then the clock strikes twelve.
Well she was told that she hadta get back away from the ball by this fairy good fairy at at twelve of the clock.
So she rushes out of there.
She goes home.
She gets in the carriage.
The carriage is already disintegrated.
She was sitting on a little pumpkin.
Ultimately she gets home back to wherever she was working.
I am assuming that she was a some kind of a maid or something.
Anyway then the it appears as the prince's father or his servant came over with a slipper.
He was searching for whoever the slipper would fit.
He tried the other sisters or maid or other people that lived in the house.
I am i forget now whether they were her sisters or she was just a maid for them.
She tried all them and it did not work.
So then finally he looked at cinderella and tried it on cinderella.
It fit her foot.
So then the whoever the servant was he rushed her off.
She run to the prince.
She got all dressed up again.
They got married and lived happily ever after.
Well the task is how how does one make a peanut butter and and jelly sandwich.
To start with that you hafta take two pieces of bread.
Select the the type of bread that you best like to eat because a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a dining experience.
It you should select the type of peanut butter again that you most like.
I like crunchy peanut butter and therefore i would have crunchy preferably extra crunchy peanut butter.
To make the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich you would want to take a a knife.
Finally select the type of jelly or jam that you best prefer.
I would prefer probably strawberry preserves with big chunks of strawberry in them.
On the other side of the bread i would apply again another quarter inch or so of of of strawberry jam.
It should be cut in half.
It should be eaten immediately immediately with a cold glass of milk.
This in this picture there is a a series of unfortunate events.
It looks like it all started with the cat that climbed up into the tree maybe after a bird.
Actually it almost looks like it is sleeping very comfortably in branch.
The little girl is is standing and jumping underneath the branch trying to get the cat to jump down but is unable to do so.
That was followed by her father climbing up into the tree using a ladder to help get the cat down.
Unfortunately the ladder fell down while he was still up in the tree.
Meanwhile the dog is furiously barking base of the tree because the dad is is stuck up in the tree and the cat is as well.
Someone has called the fire department finally to bring another ladder to help get both dad and the cat out of the tree.
The firemen are are quickly running over to the tree to help everyone out.
A i i guess to describe a particularly happy or sad event in in my life i would select a maybe a a recent one.
Back in mid february my daughter left flew out of cinicinnati in kentucky greater cinicinnati area airport to frankfurt germany to begin her studies in heidelberg germany.
So she her flight left at about eleven of the clock in the morning.
My wife and i then we drove her up to cinicinnati.
Happy because she was leaving and and and going on to this you know new stage in her life.
She is you know really she is lived close to us all of her life.
But it is it was very good to get back and visit her over spring break to know that she is doing well and enjoying herself.
Fortunately with electronic communications as they are my wife and she communicate at least oh multiple times a week.
It is really a wonderful thing to be able to have that that sort of connection.
He is playing soccer.
In panel one he is he is shows that he is playing soccer.
He kicks the ball with his right foot.
Presumably mistakenly puts it directly through the center of a large plate glass window.
There just so happens to be a gentleman who is sitting chair by the the very window that the ball comes crashing through.
The ball hits a a lamp.
Knocks the lamp over gentleman who is clearly very surprised that this is happening.
In panel four he picks up the soccer ball.
Is looking out the window clearly unhappy about what is happened.
In this story there is a a small boy.
He is getting ready to go to school.
His mom knows that it is there is a a prediction for rain that day.
So she is encouraging him to take an umbrella along with him.
But he says.
He really does not needta have an umbrella today and does not want to take it.
In panel two he says.
Mom is still a little concerned that he is going to get rained on.
But she she holds the umbrella back.
In panel three he is walking off to school.
He gets part way there.
It starts to rain.
The rain starts falling down.
It is as shown in panel four the rain is coming down heavier now.
Puddles puddles are accumulating.
The little boy realizes he is going to get absolutely soaked by the time he gets to school unless he turns around and goes home.
So he does that.
In panel five he gets into the door.
He must get changed up just a little bit.
He is walking back to school this time with an umbrella.
Well this picture shows a a rescue a gentleman whose has a orange vest on with some some kind of belt which must be useta fasten him onto maybe to a line to a wire that is or a rope that is holding him onto the shore.
He is coming out into a a really torrent of a river which probably occurred because of some flooding upstream causing a flash flood.
There is a young woman who is grasping onto a branch.
Presumably she got washed down the stream got caught up somehow.
The gentleman who is coming in to rescue her then is pulling himself down the limb to where the young woman is.
At this point it looks like he will be able to get to her safely and and have his colleagues on on the shore to pull them both to safety again.
Okay story cinderella it it begins with cinderella as a little girl.
She has a a little puppy dog who is her friend.
Her father is remarries to to a woman who has two young girls of her own.
The and the story starts with with the that new family coming together.
The stepmother turns out to be a rather unlikable character here.
She does not really care for her new stepdaughter.
That is actually the last time we see the father.
So presumably the father disappears somehow.
He dies or or something happens and he is removed from the the family.
The story focuses on the interactions that happen there.
As cinderella is growing up her stepmother and the stepsisters abuse her.
She she takes it all in stride.
The stepmother and and stepsisters really never never develop any affinity for her.
But cinderella develops a fondness for many animals including her dog but then also mice and other animals environment home.
She happens to live very close by to the castle.
Dreams of all the wonderful things that happen in that place.
One day the chancellor and other staff within the castle decide that they hafta have a ball because the young prince is at a point where he needs to select a bride to to get married to carry on the the the lineage of the royal family.
So they send out a a notice to all of the families in town inviting particularly inviting all of the young woman who are of marriageable age to to come to this ball.
Meanwhile cinderella dreams of the you know the everything that could possibly be in going to this ball.
Not even necessarily thinking about getting married to the prince but just you know it could be so wondrous.
But she knows does not have clothing suitable for that or anything else.
In talking with her animal friends in particular the mice decide that they will make her a beautiful ball dress.
So they do.
She when when it is time to leave for the ball cinderella appears with to the stepmother with her stepsisters dressed in some beautiful ball dress and ready to go.
They are they are very angry that she would have the effrontery to actually think that she could go to the ball being just a poor wait staff at this point in her life.
So they destroy her dress.
Tear up her jewelry that was prepared for her.
At that point cinderella has a fairy godmother.
That is where the fairy godmother enters into the story.
She talks with cinderella.
Cinderella says of course that she does want to go to the ball but she has no way of getting there and no no clothing suitable.
So the fairy godmother creates a beautiful white ball dress for cinderella.
I believe one of the mice gets turned into the the driver for cart.
So off she goes to the ball.
She enters into the ballroom.
They have a lovely time.
But she recognizes that the her fairy godmother told her she must leave by midnight or she everything will turn back into its former state.
So she she running out of the palace running down the stairs with the chancellor chasing after her trying to get her name to find out who she is because the prince has fallen madly in love with her already.
As she is dashing down the stairs she leaves one of her slippers which is made of glass.
Although she does get away before the chancellor can get her.
Is transported back home at which time everything comes back to to normal her normal life.
The the the cart becomes a a pumpkin again.
The prince was just enchanted with this young woman he met.
He wants to know who she is.
All he has to tie this this missing person to the person he loves is this glass slipper.
So he he his people from his palace leave and they they go through throughout the entire town trying to find the young woman whose foot could fit into this glass slipper.
They go from house to house and nil of them fit.
None can fit until he gets to cinderella's home.
Of course the stepmother would like her foot tried out.
But it does not fit.
Neither do the feet of the stepsisters.
They are about ready to leave when they realize that there is another young woman present in the house cinderella.
The stepmother and stepsisters try to dissuade the the courtiers from from fitting this the shoe to her foot.
But they insist and find that in fact it does fit.
They have finally located the woman that the prince is madly in love with.
Shortly thereafter she is brought to the palace.
A little girl was outside playing when the dog came chase and chased her kitty cat up a tree.
Well the the father went up the tree to try to get the cat.
His ladder fell down.
So the girl went in and told her mother.
She came back out.
The mother called the the fire department to come help not only rescue the cat but rescue her husband also.
First you get the bread out of the cupboard.
Then you get the jelly out of the refrigerator.
Then you get the peanut butter out of the cupboard.
Then you take the peanut butter.
First you open up the you take two lil slices of bread out of the package.
Then you lay ththem flat.
You get the peanut butter.
Then i usually get another knife.
That is how i like to make my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Then you put the two slices together.
Then you eat it.
Then in two thousand two he developed cancer.
He passed away.
I had had three children through him.
I have three grandchildren.
Then in two thousand four i met someone.
He was the first person that i had ever dated in thirty years.
We just hit it off really well together.
I we we got married in december of two thousand four.
We have been married now for four years.
We moved to from the cincinnati area to lexington.
There was a little boy outside playing soccer with a soccer ball kicking it and kicking it.
All of a sudden he kicked it way too hard.
It flew right through the window.
As it flew through the window it happened to hit the his father who was sitting there on a chair.
It knocked over a lamp.
Well his father got up.
Looked out the window to see what was going on.
A little boy wanted to go outside to play.
But his mother said.
You take the umbrella in case it rains.
So he said.
No i do not need the umbrella.
It will i do not think it is going to rain.
So all of a sudden he walks outside.
He he is got his backpack on.
Then it starts to rain.
So he runs back to his mother and soaking wet.
His mother does not look very happy with him.
So then when he he goes back out he has his umbrella with him.
All the sudden a thunderstorm came up.
Looks like that the area she was swimming in got flooded.
This currents started to form.
So she got caught tree.
Because she was in trouble the rescue man came and rescued her.
Cinderella as she was a little girl she lived with her father.
Well her mother had died so her father remarried.
As cinderella grew the the lady she married had two little girls too.
She would make cinderella work all around the house.
Cinderella cooked and cleaned and and did everything.
She did not wear such nice clothes.
But the the mother's daughters got to wear all the pretty clothes.
Well one day there was an announcement that the prince country was going to have a ball.
So the the ugly stepsisters were invited.
Cinderella was not allowed to go because the stepmother would not let her go to the ball.
They left to go to the ball.
Cinderella hadta stay back behind.
As she stayed back behind she started to cry.
Well all of a sudden this beautiful woman appeared.
She made her a beautiful dress to wear to the ball.
Were she turned into horses.
The pumpkin she turned into a carriage.
She told cinderella she could go to the ball on one condition as long as she was back by midnight.
So cinderella said.
She went to the ball.
And as she went into the the room the prince noticed her right away.
So he asked her to dance with him.
So they danced all around the ball all night.
Then the clock started to to chime twelve of the clock.
Cinderella knew she hadta leave.
So she ran up the stairs and lost her little slipper which was a glass slipper.
She ran outside.
As she got outside she turned back into her old ugly dress.
The mice turned back into mice.
The carriage turned back into a pumpkin.
So she ran home.
Then she did not tell anybody where she went.
Well the prince went all around the country to try to find cinderella because he loved cinderella.
So she he went to all the maiden's houses.
Could not find who the slipper belonged to.
So finally he came to cinderella's house.
The ugly stepsisters tried on the shoe.
It would not fit would not fit anybody.
So cinderella they locked her in a closet so the prince could not see her.
Then she got out of the closet with the help of her little mice friends.
Told him that she would like to try on the shoe.
The prince bent down.
The shoe fit cinderella.
Then he knew he found his princess.
This is a picture of a a child and a maybe her father who seem to be in some distress.
Apparently a cat climbed up into a tree.
Then the father climbed up into the tree to probably rescue the cat.
However the ladder that he useta get up into the tree has fallen down.
Therefore the cat and the father are both up in the tree and neither of them can get down.
The little girl is crying because she wants her cat.
There is a dog that is barking with his front paws on the tree.
Apparently someone has called a fireman.
The the firemen have arrived with their truck.
They are coming up with their ladder to rescue the father and the cat.
The little girl has her tricycle that is close by her.
There is a bird in another branch of the tree who is probably watching what is going on.
First you assemble all the ingredients that you will need.
That may include the jar of peanut butter.
Jelly if you want jelly on it.
The bread you must select whether you want the whole wheat bread or white bread.
You might select other ingredients that you would like to put on the the sandwiches such as raisins or bananas or nuts whatever else.
So you arrange all your ingredients.
Then you you take out your slices of bread and spread them with the peanut butter.
The next step would be the jelly if you want the jelly on.
Then you pile on the other ingredients.
Put the two slices you spread with the peanut butter on one slice of bread.
Then you put the two slices together.
Then you would put up you know the rest of the peanut butter and the jelly back into the cupboard and the other ingredients.
Well at my age of course one has experienced sad events death of loved ones etcetera.
But i guess i would choose to focus on the things that are the most positive.
You were very very happy that they were born.
They were healthy and and you know very grateful.
I i wanted boys all three times.
I got boys all three times.
Although now i i could see the advantage of having a daughter.
But i do have a daughter inlaw.
So that is you know does not really a problem.
The other very happy times in my life have been the times where i have traveled and met people.
And i i do a lot of mission work.
So you know communicating with those folks and and being able to share something with them and go back and see the progress they they have made and that that is a a very gratifying you know position to be in.
The story of a little boy playing ball or kickball or he is kicking a ball.
"He kicks it through a window, breaks a window."
The ball falls man's lap as he is sitting chair.
"It breaks the window, knocks over the lamp."
"The man then picks up the ball and goes to the window, looks out."
He is probably happy about it bebecause he sees this big hole in his window.
I guess that is it.
I do not see anything else there.
Looks like a little boy is going outside.
His mother wants to give him an umbrella to take.
He decides he does not want the umbrella.
"So he goes outside and is walking on his way, has his backpack on his back and starts to rain."
He becomes a little distressed as the rain is pouring down on top of him.
So he comes back home.
He sees.
She she looks like she is got her hands on her hips.
Well i told you so.
He apparently agrees with that because then he takes off again and he has the umbrella.
It is protecting him from the rain.
He he apparently retrieves the umbrella after he goes back to his house and starts out again.
One looks like a rescuer because he has on an orange vest.
She apparently has fallen into a raging stream or river or some body of water that seems to be moving.
Then the rescuer tries to come to rescue her.
He has a belt that he has you know.
He could also be another boater that had a life jacket.
She does not have the life jacket.
So i do not know which it is.
Anyway the man who has the red life jacket on is grasping the a branch.
Both of ththem look pretty distressed.
Cinderella was had two stepsisters.
Her her mother was a stepmother who favored the stepsisters over cinderella.
So cinderella hadta serve them tea and do many of the household chores while the stepsisters did not hafta do anything.
There was an announcement impending ball that the prince was having.
The stepsisters well all of the girls were invited.
But it was decided that the only the stepsisters could go and that they would have the grand ball gowns.
But cinderella was you know feeling very dejected.
She you know kept doing her chores and everything.
A fairy godmother came by and told cinderella that she could also go to the ball too and that she would make her very beautiful and give her a beautiful gown.
So this did occur.
"She was all dressed up in her beautiful gown, went to the ball."
The prince decided that he wanted to dance with cinderella.
Is this the one that had the glass glass slipper?
There was this glass slipper and whoever it fit then the prince would dance with her.
Lo and behold cinderella the shoe fit perfectly.
So cinderella danced with the prince.
Then they you know cinderella hadta go back home in a pumpkin coach.
She hadta get back home before it you know turned into a regular pumpkin rather than the coach.
But any rate cinderella and the prince got together and lived happily ever after.
Well it looks like we have the fire department to the rescue.
Looks like they have got a couple of things that they needta correct.
Looks like a cat's caught up in a tree.
Looks like a dog's got man up a tree.
It looks like the fire department is there to rescue ththem.
Well first of all you hafta have the jelly.
You hafta have the peanut butter.
I would assume a slice of bread to put it on.
In order to do that you need a utensil probably a spoon a knife.
You put the ingredients probably the peanut butter first and spread it on the bread.
With your spoon you put some jelly on it.
I guess one of the most interesting things that happened to me when i was working as the staff engineer with a television station in in miami wtvj.
We did the paps fights on wednesday nights.
I staged the the event that night.
We had a whole series of cue cards.
We were welcoming new stations to the the air.
I flipped one over.
And i had a real sharp announcer.
He says.
Well no matter which way you look at it it is good television.
We welcome w whatever it was to to the network.
Oh it looks like a young man is kicking a soccer ball.
It crashes through a window.
Falls in the lap of a gentleman who look like he may be watching television.
He picks up the ball.
Well looks like a young man is going out to school with his backpack.
He his mother offers him an umbrella.
He steps out the door.
It starts raining.
He heads on back and soaking wet.
Momma scowls at him.
He carries the umbrella back out into the rain and on his way to school.
I am not absolutely certain what is going on.
Where they are just both holding on a limb.
Apparently cinderella's mother dies.
She inherits a stepmother with two children of her own.
They make life pretty miserable for cinderella.
So the stepmother receives the invitation.
I guess it is for cinderella but she works her two children in.
Cinderella previously her fairy godmother has subverted the stepmother's evil intent.
Anyway she goes to the the ball.
When she gets ready to leave she hasta leave in a hurry and loses a slipper.
Well she he comes to the house where cinderella her stepmother and the two evil stepsisters.
The the slipper does not fit the the two stepsisters but does fit cinderella.
He finds her.
They live happily ever after.
Well apparently the cat climbed up the tree and could not get down.
So the little girl's father climbed up the tree on the ladder to get the cat.
The ladder fell down.
Now the he and the cat are both stuck up the tree.
So someone called the fire department.
They are coming to get the father down from the tree.
I assume they are also going to get the cat down from the tree.
Everybody lived happily ever after.
Well first of all you can get two slices of bread.
You get yourself a knife.
You start spreading the peanut butter on the bread as thick as you can get it on there.
You put it on both pieces of bread.
Then you put the two pieces of bread together.
You have a peanut butter sandwich.
It required on the drawer fronts for me to route some little grooves around on the face of the door frame.
You know they are pretty big drawer fronts.
So i i get it all set up with the fixture around there so i can set my router down.
I can follow along that little fence that i set around there.
Well this happened to be a particular router that i have not really used in that particular manner for quite some time.
I use it for other things.
The router that i normally would use was at the repair shop.
Oh a router is a nice little circular base ya know.
You cannot get in trouble following a fence.
I mean circle it.
I mean you know it is got to go in a straight line.
Well this router had a little tiny piece going up the side that extended out past that circle in one little spot.
I had the router turned just a little bit bebecause it is a circle.
I do not care whether it is turned or.
That little piece stuck out there.
So where i was syoupposed to go.
I mean oh and i mean it stuck out just right that i made a perfectly straight line.
But when i got done with it i am looking at it.
I am saying.
Board is trashed.
You know firewood.
So i said.
Well okay i will get the second drawer front.
I will i will do this one.
But i still go around and around.
You got to make several passes at this.
So it takes awhile to do this.
I mean the very last.
I probably could have even gotten by without making that pass.
But i thought.
We will make one last pass.
I mean i am going and i come around here.
I come down here.
I come down here.
I go around over here.
Just as i am getting ready to go up that way the router suddenly goes this way.
Because somehow or other i managed to stand on the electric cord.
The cord would not go any further.
Little girl's getting anxious for this filing cabinet.
Hoping i was going to be done with it sunday.
So finally last night i finally finished the the drawer front.
Now i will maybe get it done tonight er tomorrow.
I i could not believe that i did two really stupid things right in a row.
I mean if it had been something that was really complicated well.
Look like a boy's out in the front yard practicing his soccer kicking ability.
It went through the picture window in the front room.
As luck would have it his dad was sitting in the chair right beside the window.
As the soccer ball came through the broken window.
Father looks out the window.
Sees see what the boy is doing.
Am i going to continue on?
Assuming that he is going out and having a little talk with his son.
Mom is trying to convince him to take the umbrella.
Because she believes it is going to rain.
He thinks it is not going to rain.
So there is no reason to take the umbrella bebecause it is not going to rain.
He no sooner gets on his way.
It starts to rain.
He turns around to go back home.
It starts raining harder.
By the time he gets home he is very soaking wet.
His mom is standing there scolding him.
Telling him he should have taken the umbrella.
Now he knows he should have.
He takes his umbrella.
That caused a girl to fall into the river.
She had somehow managed to catch onto a tree branch to stay there.
Someone had called the rescue squad to come and save her.
This shows a policeman with his lifesaving lifevest on.
He is hanging on the branch.
Mhm trying going to put a belt around her so that they can haul her to to safety.
Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters and their their mother.
All three of ththem treated cinderella as their own maid or personal servant.
It was announced that there was going to be a a ball at the prince's castle.
Cinderella started to get excited about it.
But they let her know in no uncertain terms that she was not going to go to the ball.
So cinderella was feeling badly about it.
Poof all of a sudden her fairy godmother shows up.
You will be going to the ball.
So she waves her magic wand.
And a carriage made out of pumpkins shows up and she gets in.
The fairy godmother says.
Now remember you hafta be back by midnight because all of this disappears at midnight.
She went to the ball.
Prince danced with her quite often.
She began to lose track of time.
But had hurried so fast that she had left one of her slippers at the ballroom.
The next day the the prince was so enthralled with her that he was trying to find out who she was.
Noone knew.
All he had was the silver slipper.
And whoever it fit that was going to be the girl.
Although they did everything to prevent cinderella from trying on the slipper.
It worked out that she did did get to try the slipper on.
It fit perfectly.
As the story goes the prince and cinderella lived happily ever after.
Well the little girl's cat got up in the tree.
Then the father climbed the tree to rescue it.
I think he is barking at the cat probly.
The girl she rode her tricycle over to the tree.
The firemen are coming with their ladder to rescue them from the tree.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
All the good times we have had.
He is been gone for eighteen years.
I still miss him.
But with all the advertisements for father's day it brings back a lot of memories.
But he lived to be eighty seven so he lived a good long life.
He fell and broke his hip is mainly what took his life.
But when he broke his hip that he never really recovered from that.
Just a few weeks or a month he died.
I was with him just shortly before he died.
I i did not know he was going to die that night when i left him.
But we had such a good time that day.
He was in the hospital bed but he talked a lot.
We reminisced.
It was a good ending for his life i mean with me since he did die that night.
He lived in cincinatti.
We we lived in cincinatti growing up.
We would go to coney island.
I was the only one who would ride the roller coaster with him.
I did not really like it.
But since dad wanted somebody to ride it with him everyone else was afraid.
Want me to go on?
Well the young boy is playing with looks like a soccer ball.
He is he kicks it.
It goes through the window.
But i suppose it is his own house.
It goes right through the window into the room where the apparently the father is sitting.
He is very surprised to see that ball come in.
He picks the ball up.
Goes to the window to look out to see who kicked the ball.
It does not show the boy do not know whether the father saw him or not.
The little child is going to leave.
The mother wants him to take an umbrella.
But he apparently tells her he does not want the umbrella.
He does not think he needs it.
So when he gets on his way to where he is going it starts to rain.
He gets very wet.
When he gets home he is dripping wet.
His mother is very sad because he would not take the umbrella.
So then he leaves again with the umbrella.
He is happy that he is going to stay dry.
He is going to help the girl who is apparently drown without his help.
He is rescuing her.
She is holding onto a tree limb.
I think the it has a happy ending because he is gotten to her.
She will be saved.
They were going to a ball with cinderella.
I do not remember exactly why cinderella could not go.
She hadta stay home and do the work.
And oh my it is at the end why she she was the only one where the golden slipper fit her foot.
So she went off with the prince in the horse drawn carriage.
Okay when i was fifteen i won a big prize for art when i was at a school in in england.
I happened to be in a program there.
You could either take secretarial skills or office skills or or domestic skills.
There was not any place for me in either one of those.
So i took extra art which was fine with me.
But because i had taken so much art i got to make a lot of things.
I sent examples of my work off to a big exhibition which was published by a newspaper.
I won the first prize.
It is a bit like being american idol or something in that you know?
People are taking photographs of you.
But there were many exciting things that came from it.
I got to meet a lot of famous people who you know whose names are in books and who are in the art world.
That is a nice thing to say.
Well i met that person.
Got to go to you know lovely receptions and things like that.
I got the next year i went to art school instead of.
In england you do not hafta stay at school beyond sixteen.
So when i was sixteen i entered art school.
I think you know my having not so much won the prize but done the work that i had done with my teacher in school whose name was mister greenwood.
I hafta acknowledge that he was really a person who prepared me well for art school.
He really did.
So that was a a life changing experience.
Boy worst thing happens goes through the glass.
Lands in the lap of what looks like dad.
Dad looks out the window not quite sure what to do.
But the boy's going to get it i think.
Take this umbrella it is going to rain.
So he waves goodbye.
Boy it starts to rain pours and pours.
He is much happier when he puts up his umbrella.
Once upon a time there was a little girl.
She was riding her tricycle.
She had a cat.
The cat's ran up the tree and got out on a low lying branch.
She was screaming screaming screaming for her cat to come down.
Well her daddy is such a sweet daddy decided to climb the tree.
He had a ladder.
Just as he got onto the branch big branch to try to reach the cat the ladder fell down.
The dog of course went bananas and was trying to help daddy get down.
The sound of the dog barking alerted the neighbors who are not in the picture.
But they called the fire department to come and rescue daddy and the cat.
A man reaches out on a branch.
Maybe his feet are still attached to the soil.
He is got belts on him.
He is got a belt around his arm that looks like the girl could hold onto it.
I cannot see her hand.
I see her reaching in a kind of reaching way that she might be about ready to put her arm into that belt that is there.
He is trying to get her out of the water which it looks really really dangerous.
You know it is a big rescue scene.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella.
Oh i mean it was actually ella.
Her mommy died.
Daddy was left alone with her.
Well one day he announced to little ella that he was going to get married again.
So he welcomes into his house little ella's stepmother and her two rather formidable looking daughters.
Well he thinks it is going to be wonderful.
Of course he is busy off doing whatever he does merchant or whatever.
But stepmother and the girls have different plans for little ella who they call cinderella because she basically cleans the fireplace and works in the cinders.
But the people who do love her are all the animals.
They love her mouse to the horse to all the other animals they love her dearly.
At night when she is getting ready to go to bed in her little room in the attic she looks out and sees a palace far away.
Some way some day i will get out of here.
I will be able to go out and be something that i want to be.
Meanwhile up at the palace the king is very disturbed that his son does not seem to be dating if princes date or having anybody suitable to to marry.
He is got to get married because we have got to have another heir.
So he decides to issue an invitation to all the eligible young ladies in the kingdom.
They will all get an invitation to come to the party so that maybe out of that lot the prince can find a suitable mate.
So the invitation arrives at cinderella's house.
Cinderella goes.
They go.
They make fantastic plans for their dresses.
Cinderella goes upstairs and opens up her little chest.
Finds her dress which she has been secretly making and hoping that one day she would get to do something fun.
When she comes downstairs with her dress they just laugh and hoot and carry on and are very unfazed.
The invitation was not issued for you.
So she puts her lil dress back in there is is very sad.
They go off to the ball.
She sits there by the cinders and feels very.
Suddenly oh this lovely lady appears kind of little old chubby lady with a wand.
She said.
She says.
I wanted to go so much to the ball.
All i had is this dress.
She puts her dress on just to imagine that she could pretend.
She said.
Well i can make that even finer.
She turns it into the absolutely splendid white silvery ball gown.
She has the most beautiful little glass slippers on and a little star in her hair.
She looks quite wonderful.
Off she goes to the ball.
Once the clock strikes twelve everything will go back as it was.
Well she gets there.
She comes in.
She is announced given some fabulous name like the princess dooda or something.
Here she comes down the steps.
The sisters think.
They do not quite recognize.
They think there is something familiar about her but they cannot quite think.
They are really shocked and very jealous that this gorgeous person is dancing with the prince all the time and they do not get a look at him.
So she hears the clock begin to strike.
She runs away from the prince.
He runs after her begging her to stay.
She says.
I hafta go.
I hafta go.
As she goes down the steps she drops one of her slippers.
Just as she gets to the carriage it turns back into a pumpkin.
She kind of walks home.
She thinks.
So she says.
Well if nothing else happens i have that wonderful night to remember.
I will never forget that.
He is gone and fallen in love with a woman and she is disappeared.
What am i going to do?
So he calls the the chamberlain.
He says.
Go around to everywhere everyone to whom this invitation was sent.
See if one of those damsels can wear this slipper.
He says tries it on the sisters trying to get their big oldd feet into this beautiful little slipper.
He says.
Do you have any other daughters?
Well we do not have anyone else.
I think somebody in the house says.
Well there is cinderella.
Well mother stepmother immediately says.
So he said.
I needta see her.
I needta see everybody who in whose household an invitation came.
So cinderella is brought in.
He tries the slipper on her.
Of course it fits.
Well off she goes to the palace.
Even the sisters get excited because cinderella being the angel person that she is r you know harbors no ill will.
She says.
You can come to the palace.
You know when i invite you you can come.
I do not think she gives them free run of the palace but you know.
You of course already have gotten your jar of peanut butter.
You spread the peanut butter on there.
You go to the refrigerator.
Then you cut it in half.
Serve it to whomever you are serving it to.
There was a dad and a little girl and a cat and a dog.
He was climbing up in the tree to get the cat down.
The little girl was riding a tricycle.
She and the dog knocked the ladder away from the tree where the dad was climbing up.
Since they were not tall enough to get him down somehow the firemen knew to come and bring a ladder.
So they are going to rescue him.
The first thing you do is get the peanut butter and jelly out on the counter.
The the last thing that is just a very happy thing is my second grandchild was born.
Not only that but while his mother was in the hospital i got to keep his brother at my house and and explain to him what was happening.
So i was the the one that got to tell him all of that and took him to visit his little baby brother and his mom in the hospital.
I just felt really good about being a nana.
There is a little boy outside playing soccer.
He kicks the soccer ball.
It goes through the window of the house and breaks it.
The ball goes inside to where his father is sitting in the chair.
The father actually catches the ball and stands up to see what in the world happened to his window and why is the ball inside.
I think the little boy is getting ready to go to school.
He has a backpack on.
His mom is trying to get him to take an umbrella.
He does not want to so he he does not take it from her.
He goes outside.
It does begin to rain.
He runs and runs.
He gets all wet and then comes back into the house to his mother and gets the umbrella and uses it after he is already soaking wet.
A young lady has been caught in the swirling water.
But there is a rescue man there who has on a life jacket.
He is holding on to a tree limb.
So she is going to be rescued by the fireman.
There was a dad who had a little girl.
He got married again.
She had two adult grown daughters of her own.
There was a decree came out in the kingdom that the prince was going to invite all of the eligible young ladies to come to the castle for a ball.
So the wicked stepmother and her daughters got all dressed up.
They made cinderella help them get dressed and all that kind of thing.
Then cinderella knew about this ball too.
So she looked at a book to see maybe how she should dress but she did not have the proper clothes.
But she wore some of her stepsisters' clothes.
When they saw that she was there they started taking her jewelry away from her and and tearing her sashes off and that kind of thing.
But cinderella had a fairy godmother.
So when she realized what was happening she gave cinderella with the touch of a wand a beautiful dress.
She turned a pumpkin into a chariot.
I think she turned mice into the horsemen or the horses.
I forget who she turned into the driver.
But anyway cinderella arrived at the ball.
The prince was so smitten by her that he immediately asked her to dance.
But the fairy godmother had told cinderella that she hadta be out of there midnight because then she would go back to being cinderella in her tattered clothes again.
As she was leaving she was in a really big hurry to get out of there before they could see her.
She dropped a glass shoe.
So the the prince's men saw that she had dropped the shoe.
So he he hadta find out who who had been there.
So the the the prince had his people go to all of the single people in the area to see who the shoe fit.
So he came to cinderella's house and the two wicked stepsisters tried the shoe on and they could not even get it on.
So cinderella asked to try it on and they made all kinds of fun of her and that kind of thing.
But but they said no everybody hasta try it on.
So she tried it on and it fit.
So she got to go to the castle.
She and the prince lived happily ever after.
Okay this is a story about a cat that climbed up a tree.
The little girl is rides her tricycle.
She is holding her arms up so that she catch the cat.
The dog is barking.
The fire department gets called.
They bring their truck and ladder.
They were going to climb up the ladder to the tree and rescue the cat.
Well the best way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to have stuff ready.
Then put the second piece of bread over the first piece of bread that has the peanut butter and jelly on it.
So you can have two halves of both on the sandwich.
That is how you do it.
When i was twelve years old i was playing little league baseball.
I was batting clean up.
One day we were playing the tigers.
Are we recording this?
Joe wilde was pitching for the tigers.
John farmer who was a a real power hitter was hitting hitting before me.
So there we had two men on base.
They walked farmer so that bases were loaded.
I took two two balls and two strikes.
Then joe wilde put a fast ball down the middle.
I swung.
I hit the ball.
It went over the center field wall.
This is a story about a kid playing soccer out in the front yard.
It goes through the front window of the house.
It is raining outside.
So the mom gives the little boy the umbrella.
The little boy takes off school.
That they have been floating down the river.
And the the boat overturns.
There is a little girl in the boat.
She is stranded.
So the rescue workers come.
They grab hold of the little girl.
Rescue her from the raging current of the water.
Basically cinderella is a girl who has two sisters.
And her mother and father were going off to a ball at the the castle.
She wishes that she could go to the ball at the castle.
All of the sudden the fairy godmother shows up.
She turns into a beautiful princess.
She goes off to the ball.
The clock strikes.
She dances with the prince.
The clock strikes twelve.
Then the prince lays on the golden slipper.
Okay a man climbed up into a tree to rescue a cat that was out on a branch.
The he used a ladder to climb up but the ladder has fallen down.
His daughter is waiting to catch the cat.
She is standing because she got off her tricycle.
There is a dog at the tree trunk barking.
The fire department have come to rescue the man or the cat out of the tree.
They drove the fire truck over.
Two firemen got out.
They are carrying the ladder over for the rescue.
Yes a little boy went out to practice soccer.
He kicked the ball into the neighbor's window.
The neighbor was sitting just on the other side of the window in the house.
Looked out the window to see where the ball came from.
Okay one morning a mother's little boy was getting ready to go to school she tried to get him take an umbrella.
He said.
Nah no i do not need that umbrella.
So the mother said.
The boy went outside.
It was raining.
It was raining even harder.
There were puddles around.
He was getting wet.
So he went back home.
His mom saw how wet he was.
This time when he went outside he took the umbrella with him.
The little boy put on his life jacket.
A little girl came by in the water.
They were talking about their problems.
Okay i keep my bread in the refrigerator.
So first i would go to the refrigerator.
Okay my husband had a heart attack.
The day he had the heart attack i had cleaned house planning to play bridge that night.
He had laid around on the couch all day.
Along about three maybe i put a roast into the pressure cooker to cook for supper.
Three thirty or so he came up to tell me that he was beginning to be nauseated.
Well we would gone to the doctor the day before.
The doctor had started him on blood pressure medicine and an antibiotic.
We both had upper respiratory infections.
So i just naturally thought maybe the antibiotic was making him sick.
I called the doctor's office.
They said that his doctor was not in.
I asked if he could see another doctor.
So we loaded up and went to the car.
He was still nauseated.
We got over there.
So we took a container over walk in clinic.
I registered him.
We sat there maybe twenty minutes.
My husband was getting sicker and sicker.
Still they did not call us back.
So i went up to the counter.
Asked if there was a doctor in the building.
Well maybe five minutes later they finally got us back to an examining room.
The doctor started talking about indigestion.
Since my husband has had stomach problems he knew what indigestion was.
He said.
Finally she asked him said.
Well what do you thinks wrong with you?
He said.
I am beginning to think it is my heart.
So she ordered a e k g.
They immediately as soon as that e k g came out called the ambulance.
Told me he was having a heart attack.
Okay there was once a little girl cinderella.
Her mother died.
She only had her father left to live with.
Her father remarried.
The woman he married had two other daughters.
The the stepmother made cinderella do all the housework and cleaning.
While her two daughters just sit around and enjoyed themselves and act.
So then there was to be a a dance where the prince was going to maybe find a mate to marry.
So the the two stepsisters were planning to go to the dance.
The whole countryside was invited to this dance where the prince would be looking for a wife.
Cinderella was kept busy doing work around the house.
Could not go to the dance bebecause she had too much work to do.
She found this beautiful pink dress.
She put it on to see how it looked on her.
Well the stepsisters found her in that dress.
They took the dress away.
They tore it off of her.
The stepmother put her back to work scrubbing floors and whatever.
Well the stepsisters got ready to go to the dance.
The fairy godmother appeared.
She asked cinderella if she wanted to go.
She helped cinderella.
She used her magic wand.
A pretty dress appeared.
Her her hair was done.
She had glass slippers on.
A coach with mice came to get cinderella to take her to the dance.
When she got to the dance.
Oh but she hadta be home by midnight.
When she got to the dance the prince ask cinderella to dance.
Then it was time for her to go home.
So she hadta rush out to get into the pumpkin carriage to go home.
But she lost a glass slipper.
So she got on in home.
The prince found the glass slipper.
That was the the princess the girl he wanted to marry.
So he went out.
He told his dad that.
So they started searching the countryside to see if they could find the girl that was there.
They took the slipper with ththem.
They thought that whoever they found that the slipper would fit was the princess that he wanted to marry.
So they they went out.
But when the prince came to cinderella's house only the two stepsisters got to try on that.
But then someone got cinderella.
The prince tried it the slipper on cinderella.
It fit.
So he took cinderella back to the castle to marry.
Okay at the left we see a little girl.
Who clearly has gotten up a tree and out on a limb.
Her father has climbed the tree with a ladder.
Unfortunately the ladder has fallen and hit the ground.
The dog is barking.
Probably because he is gotten excited at the cat and the father in the tree.
The firemen are coming with a ladder presumably to get both the father and the cat down.
They save the day.
Okay i would start by saying i would never make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich bebecause i do not like the two together.
If i were to do it i would start by opening up a jar of peanut butter.
I would take a knife.
I would spread the peanut butter on a piece of bread.
Then i would open up the jar of jelly.
I would take a separate knife so as not to contaminate the jelly or the peanut butter.
I would smooth it over peanut butter.
Then i would cut the peanut butter sandwich in half.
Okay i think one of the most pivotal experiences i ever had occurred after i graduated from college years ago.
I decided i would go to england for a few months.
I said.
I got there.
I liked england and other parts of europe so much that i decided to stay and stay and stay.
So i stayed for two years.
Probably the center part of alla that was when i made a trip from france to greece hitchhiking with a friend.
So we hitchhiked across southern france through italy into yugoslavia south from yugoslavia into greece.
Found people who were very generous in offering us rides in the car.
Some let us sleep in their backyard.
Two or three of ththem invited us in to spend the night.
When we got to greece we in some way found ourselves part of what was called a greco american friendship society.
So we got to travel all around the peloponnesus and stay with people that were united.
Following that experience we took a train back to paris and then to england.
Then we have another story.
Okay well the story opens with a young boy kicking what appears to be a soccer ball.
He he kicks it up.
Unfortunately it goes through the window of a house.
Landing in the lap of a man who is sitting in armchair.
He stands up.
Hasta decide.
Am i going to keep this ball or throw it back to the kid?
Well the story begins with a mother who obviously has told her son to take an umbrella out because it is going to rain.
He says.
No i do not need an umbrella.
He gives it back to his mother.
He goes out.
Of course it begins to rain.
He gets wet and he is very angry.
He comes back.
His mother is not very happy at him because he is gotten wet.
So next time he goes out to walk in the rain he takes an umbrella.
Well in this story there is only one picture.
We must suppose that there has been a flood.
Then a young girl has been swept out into a stream which has become a river.
Because there is so much water flowing and so much rain.
She is clinging to the branch of a tree.
But someone from the fire department has come out into the stream.
We do not know the success of his efforts.
But we can only assume he looks like he knows what he is doing.
Okay once there was a young girl who lost her mother.
Her father married again.
She lived with her stepmother and her stepsisters.
But instead of treating her well they made her do the dirty work.
She became a kind of scullery maid.
She would take care of the dishes and wash the clothes.
She as it turned out was a lovely girl while the stepsisters of course had faces to match their evil characters.
She read books.
She often imagined that someday she would be able to meet her prince and live happily ever afterwards.
The family one day received a letter from the palace inviting them to a ball.
Of course they they had accepted for themselves mother and the stepdaughters but not for cinderella.
She hadta stay home with all these little disneylike characters who keep kind of flitting around her feet.
So she thinks she cannot go to the ball.
But as she is imagining this suddenly her fairy godmother appears.
You may go to the ball.
She furnishes her with beautiful clothes.
A coach horses coachmen and so on.
You can go to the ball have a good time but you must be back by twelve midnight.
Unfortunately she does not make it.
She does meet the prince.
She dances with the prince.
She turns to leave but she does not make it.
So everything disappears except her one little slipper which she takes with her.
The prince has fallen in love with her.
She is hidden away still doing her nasty little jobs at home.
So he proceeds to scour the countryside because he has a slipper.
He wants to find the one that will match his.
So he comes to the house of cinderella and her bad stepmother.
They hear that he has this shoe.
Use it to to to have any woman in the house try it on to see if her foot will match it.
The original version of this story has the the wicked stepsisters cutting off part of their foot so it will fit into the slipper.
But even then it does not work until it comes to cinderella.
She puts the slipper on it fits.
She marries the prince.
They live happily ever after.
Okay i have my grandchild.
She wants a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
So i get the bread out of the bread basket.
I get the jelly out of the refrigerator.
A knife to spread the peanut butter.
While she is waiting anxiously for her sandwich spread the peanut butter on the bread.
We do foldovers.
So i use one slice of bread.
I fold the the piece of bread over.
There is a little girl who has a pet cat.
It looks like she probably was riding her bicycle.
Maybe the cat was following her.
But the cat decided it wanted to go up a tree.
She calls her dog to help get the cat down.
So the father comes along.
He puts a ladder up.
He climbs the tree.
But the ladder falls over.
So some good samaritan calls the fire department.
They are going to get the cat down out of the tree.
My husband and i had five children in five and a half years.
So we spent about all of our time raising children.
So finally when i went into real estate when i was fifty three years old i started saving my money.
So we could take a nice trip to alaska.
I think i was about sixty three when we did this.
It was the most wonderful trip we have ever had.
Then we got on a ship.
We met wonderful people.
Another was a retired man who was in his eighties and had his girlfriend with him.
He owned a big pawn shop in columbus.
He was taking this trip to try to get her to say yes she would marry him.
We just had the best time.
We just learned so much from each other.
So that was just a trip that we will never forget.
We took lots of pictures.
We have an album that is just all alaska.
That was a dream come true.
And i i got to finance it.
I paid for it.
Well a little boy is out in his yard playing practicing soccer it looks like.
He kicks the ball a little bit too hard.
It goes through the neighbor's window.
So the person who owns the home is sitting inside.
A ball comes in and lands almost on his lap.
So he decides that he is going to keep the ball.
I hope he gives it back to the boy.
I am sure the boy's parents' insurance home insurance will pay for the window.
The little boy i am sure is very sorry that happened.
He says.
He does not need an umbrella.
He does not need an umbrella.
So he trots off to school with his backpack on his back.
It starts raining.
He goes to his mother.
I think he is saying.
So he gets the umbrella.
It looks like she is probably been in her car maybe.
Tried to go over a road that had too much water.
She is being washed away.
It looks like maybe a fireman or somebody who is trying to rescue her is also risking his life trying to rescue her.
I am sure he does get her rescued.
Cinderella was a beautiful little girl and she had three stepsisters.
So they did not treat her very well.
She hadta do all the scrubbing and the cleaning while the the stepsisters went about their way and had the pretty clothes and all that.
There was going to be a ball at the palace.
It was for the prince to try to find a bride.
Of course they were not going to let cinderella go.
So they got all dressed up.
Then they went to the ball.
Cinderella's just very upset that she could not go.
Suddenly her fairy godmother appears.
Tells her that she wants her to go to the ball.
She dresses her in a beautiful dress.
Has a carriage waiting for her outside with drawn by horses.
I believe it was a pumpkin.
Or maybe it turned into a pumpkin.
She gets to dance with the prince.
He just really loves her thinks she is really beautiful.
And he thinks probably he is found his his bride.
But when midnight comes she hasta be back by midnight because she is going to turn back into the little scrub girl.
Her carriage turns into a pumpkin.
So she runs down the steps.
He is running after her.
She loses one of her shoes.
So she races back and races back home.
So the prince is very sad he cannot find cinderella.
So he goes around to all the homes trying that one shoe on everybody.
So he tries it on the stepsisters.
They of course have big ugly feet.
And cinderella i think he sees her.
He says.
I want to try the shoe on you too.
When he tries it on her it fits perfect.
So he knows he is found his beautiful cinderella.
So they end up getting married and living happily ever after.
Probably one of the biggest events that happened to me in my life was playing in the nineteen fifty eight sun bowl for university of louisville.
We have had a lot of good memories from that.
Over the period of time the last fifty years actually we have gotten together for reunions the whole team has.
In fact the last uku of l game we got together for another small reunion.
Okay we would start off with two slices of bread.
Then you take the jar of jelly.
Then they put the two pieces of bread together.
Cut it in half if you so desire.
Okay well it looks like a cat climbed up the tree.
A little girl started crying about it.
So either a neighbor or her father climbed the tree ta help rescue it.
Well then the father got stuck in the tree and bebecause his ladder fell down.
He could not get back down.
One of the other neighbors called the fire department.
They are coming to the everybody's rescue.
They are going to get the cat and the father back down out of the tree.
He accidently kicks it into a window.
It breaks the window.
The man inside the house sitting there it kind of surprised him.
So he got up.
He is debating looking out at the yard as to whether he wants to return the ball again to the little boy.
Okay well the little boy looks like he is getting ready to go to school.
He has his backpack on.
Mom is saying.
She is handing him an umbrella.
He is saying.
No it is it is i do not want to carry an umbrella.
I i do not want to take it to school.
As he starts walking to school here comes the rain.
He got pretty well drenched ran back home.
His mother is standing there with a frown on her face saying you know.
You got all wet.
This time he took the umbrella with him.
Well it looks like a a bad flood hit a town.
A little girl got pulled into the water.
She was floating downstream well.
It looks like what i would consider to be a a fireman got on a a rope or something.
And he is hanging on to a tree trying to save the little girl's life.
Cases like this one they get that close i would say that everything came out just fine.
Well it starts off once upon a time.
I remember that.
There was a a young lady that was adopted by her wicked stepmother.
She had two wicked stepsisters.
She grew up there with them.
Eventually it came time for the annual ball to try and locate a a wife for the prince.
The cinderella was cleaning up the house and everything.
She really wanted to go to the ball.
The mice her friends in the house they they found a dress for her and showed it to her.
She really liked it.
She tried it on.
The wicked stepsisters did not want her to go.
They wanted her to stay at home.
So they took the dress away from her.
So she cried.
The stepsisters and the stepmother all went to the ball.
But the fairy godmother showed up.
She turned cinderella into a beautiful princess.
Gave her a pretty dress to wear.
The mice were turned into horses.
The pumpkin was made into the coach.
Everything was all hooked up.
She went to the ball together.
But she hadta be home by midnight.
So she went to the ball had a great time dancing with the prince.
Everybody wondered who this beautiful princess was dancing with the prince.
But then the clock started to strike twelve.
She ran off.
In running away she dropped one glass slipper that were made specially for her by the fairy godmother.
She could not go back for it bebecause it was almost midnight.
So she got home in time.
Then the prince was so in love with her he wanted to find her.
So he sent his coachmen out ta ta locate her.
He said.
Whoever can fit into this shoe glass slipper will be my wife.
So he went around the kingdom and finally found cinderella.
It fit her.
And then they live happily ever after.
First thing i would do would be of course make a selection between smooth or chunky peanut butter.
Then i would make a selection of the jelly that i was going to use.
Then i would go and make sure we have bread.
I would then take two slices of bread from the package.
Then i would draw a knife from the kitchen cabinet drawer.
Then i would spread the peanut butter.
In my case i would spread it evenly from corner to corner edge to edge.
Then i would take a spoon.
Then i would put the second piece of bread on top.
Then i would take another knife.
Then i would eat my sandwich.
She is standing under the branch hoping that the cat will fall into her arms.
But dad who climbed the tree is not able to go any further.
He evidently is stuck.
He cannot reach the cat.
Someone called the fire department.
They are coming to his rescue.
The dog continues to bark up the tree.
I was living in washington d c.
He shared with me that he had a young lady that came in from kentucky that is now going to be teaching at the high school.
He would like very much for me to meet her.
He planned to go on labor day weekend to the skyline drive in virginia with another lady.
To make it a foursome he asked me if i would go out with this person that i had never met.
Well i had other plans for the weekend.
But my roommate put the screws to me in that if i did not go on this date i would hafta move out and find another place to live.
So with much reluctance i agreed to do this.
So we went eh on the skyline drive on labor day weekend.
We had very good time.
I like very much this young lady.
We were engaged october the sixth.
Then we were married thanksgiving day.
I am looking at a series of four pictures.
The first picture shows a young boy kicking a volleyball.
Lo and behold it goes right through a window.
The gentleman that owns the house is sitting in a chair.
When the volleyball comes through the window.
Strikes the lamp knocks it on the floor.
The owner is then looking out the window to see what happened with the volleyball in his hand.
It looks as though the mother is saying goodbye to the child as he is going to school.
But she is trying to explain to hi am that it looks like it is going to be rain raining today.
You needta take your umbrella.
The little boy says.
No i do not think i need an umbrella.
Then it shows him outside in the rain getting soaked.
He comes back in.
His mother of course is very disgruntled as he stands there soaking wet.
To make the story happy ending he has now agreed to carry the umbrella to school.
It appears to be flooded.
I would say from the dress of the individual in dark blue shirt he must be a volunteer or a regular fireman with a pfd type three vest on clinging to a branch trying to get to this young girl.
He has a belt buckle.
I am not sure if the belt buckle is around the girl or not.
It could be he just used it for giving her something to hold onto.
The water is swirling which tells me that this is a very strong current.
From that i do not know whether they were successful or not in rescuing.
I believe she was an aunt to cinderella.
But the two little girls were spoiled.
They felt as though they were much superior to cinderella.
The master of the home he sort of favored cinderella.
He was torn between the two.
The master tried to make cinderella happy in her home.
But she wanted to go to the ball.
The sinister aunt wanted her daughters to go because there was supposedly going to be a prince there.
Cinderella did not know whether she could go or not.
Involved in all of this there was supposedly a magic slipper made of glass or crystal.
Whoever was able to wear this slipper was going to be part of the prince life.
So they went to the ball.
The sinister daughters tried the slipper on.
It would not fit.
Lo and behold cinderella showed up.
They lived happily ever after.
A little girl loses her cat.
It gets up in the tree.
It will not come down.
The dad goes up in the tree to get it.
But he loses the ladder.
Someone calls the fire department.
Here they come with the ladder.
I would get the bread out hopefully butternut.
I would get a knife out.
I would spread butter on it.
I would get the jelly out.
I would spread the jelly on it.
I would put everything back up.
I put the sandwich together.
I cut it in half.
Had the reservoir on the side and the warming oven set at the top.
We had what we called the stove wood box.
We had a big box that our stove wood that we burned in this cook stove was placed in.
I can remember mother sitting on this box of wood and telling me that i was not their daughter.
I knew my actual father and all my brothers and sisters.
But i thought he was my uncle.
I thought they were my cousins.
I knew their mother was dead.
But i did not know she was my mother.
She had died when i was two weeks old from childbirth.
The man and woman that took me she was my birth father's sister and her husband.
But first another family had taken me because i weighed less than three pounds.
They just kind of put me off in a room bebecause my mother was really bad sick.
They they did not think i was going to live.
So another family had said they would take me one of my birth mother's brother and his wife.
"I remember mother telling me that when she and daddy went up to check on zelma, which was my mother's name, that they asked about the baby."
They said.
She will never make it.
So they they saw about me while i was there.
They told ththem said you know.
She she needs a doctor.
They hadta go ahead and leave.
But my uncle which would have been my uncle he and his wife had taken me on to their home.
About a week after that my mother died.
The lady and her husband that actually ended up raising me.
The other uncle had called them and said.
We cannot take care of this child.
She needs medical help.
We do not have the money.
We have a baby.
Would you all come and get her?
So they came and got me.
Fortunately they lived next door to a doctor.
The doctor lived next door to ththem.
Mother had help in the house.
She and eva mcdaniel carried me on a pillow for six months until i actually was beginning to weigh about five or six pounds.
"This doctor that lived next door, doctor price, mother said that he you know took very good care of me."
I i was born without a lining in my stomach.
Some bones back here in the back of my neck that were not very well developed.
So i grew up in this fairly fashionable lifestyle.
I went to school under the name lastname until i was about eight even though my maiden name really was lastname.
All pulaski county knew it but me.
So the school wrote mother and daddy a letter.
You hafta tell her.
We cannot continue to send her to school under a name that is not her real name.
So that is why they ever told me.
So you know i spent a lot of years trying to deal with it.
When i was forty five i sent to frankfort for my birth certificate.
Mother and daddy always told me my birthday was may the thirteenth nineteen thirty eight.
I sent to frankfort for my birth certificate.
But my birth certificate had a number of problems.
It said my birthday was may the fifteenth nineteen and eighty three.
It said to this woman had been born seven other children all of which are dead.
Now the midwife had signed it june the fifteenth.
She signed it the right year.
She signed it nineteen thirty eight but june the fifteenth.
She either signed it on the day i was borned and nobody remembered or she signed it a month later.
So i hadta get an attorney to get the year.
They would not change the date.
They said.
You needta notify your social security and your insurance companies that you are you had used the wrong birthday.
I hadta find an attorney that knew me that would certify that i definitely had not been borned in nineteen eighty three.
That it was very obvious that i had been borned in nineteen thirty eight.
He referred to the birth certificate date too.
I do not know that that will ever do anybody any good.
But nobody believes me when i tell ththem.
He kicked a soccer ball.
It went right through this window.
This guy was sitting obviously doing something very relaxing maybe watching a little t v.
He picks the soccer ball up looks at the hole in his window.
There is this little boy.
He is getting ready to go to school.
He is wanting to take off to school without his umbrella.
Well he does that.
He gets rained on really badly.
When he comes home the mom is really upset because he is all wet.
Well it is still raining the next morning.
She makes him take the umbrella.
There was this little girl lost in high waters.
She is holding on to a tree.
The rescue worker gets to the tree.
There was a guy that let this woman in with these kids.
She was watching out the window.
She found a glass shoe.
She somebody helped her go to this dance.
She lost her shoe.
The prince came along.
He took her away.
A little girl's kitten got out outside and went up a tree.
He climbed out on a limb.
He got scared and could not come back.
She could not get the kitty or she could not reach it.
She got a ladder.
She could not reach it with the ladder.
So she got her daddy to come and see if he could get it.
So her daddy got up the tree.
He could not reach it either.
So they called the fire department.
While they were coming the dog started barking at her in all the excitement.
That is all that happened in this chapter.
First you put on peanut butter on the bread.
Then with the knife you spread the jelly on the peanut butter.
You put ththem together.
I talked to him one day.
I ask him how he got to be this way.
He told me his people teased him about being jewish.
So i decided i would devise a plan to help him get better.
So each session i thought i would talk to him about how jewish people tended to have lower delinquency rates than others.
I said.
I told him that jewish people tend to have less alcoholism.
I said.
Jewish people have low alcoholism rates.
I talked to him about how there oh different things a couple more.
You know he began to get a little better.
He got to be on open ward.
They cut his medicine some more.
He went home.
Every year he sent me a hannukah card for the next five years.
Then i never heard from him again.
He messes up and knocks it through a window.
The person in the house is startled by the soccer ball coming through his window.
He picks it up.
He looks out to see who threw this soccer ball in the window.
A little boy is fixing to go out.
His mother wants him to take the umbrella.
He says.
He will not need the umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
He goes out.
It rains.
So then he takes the umbrella like she wanted him to do to start with to go back out in the rain.
There been raining a lot.
She tried to go through some high water.
She got stuck in the middle.
Could not get the car to go on any further.
She could not back it up.
She ended up on top of the car.
The rivers continued to flood.
Finally she was just swept away.
Somebody saw her and called the rescue people.
So she went on down the high water.
The rescue people came.
The guy was climbing out hanging to the limb too trying to get hold of her to rescue her to bring her back to safety.
Once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella.
Her mother died.
Her father remarried.
A a wicked stepmother came with her stepdaughters to live with ththem.
The stepdaughters did not like cinderella.
They made her do all kinds of menial things.
She hadta do the scrubbing and mopping and things that nobody else wanted to do.
One day the it was announced that there there was a royal ball.
The the prince was going to be there.
The stepdaughters all connived on how which one of them got to go or who was going to get what to wear and which one was going to be the most beautiful and stuff.
So cinderella wished she could go.
Then along comes a fairy godmother sort of person who says well she would help cinderella.
So she says.
But i do not have anything to wear.
I could not go to a ball.
So magically she gets her a beautiful gown.
She gets her all dressed up.
She said.
I have no way to get there.
So lo and behold the fairy godmother gets her a a a pumpkin as a carriage.
And the carriage takes her right on to the thing.
She goes to the ball.
She dances and really enjoys it.
Then lo and behold the the prince kind of notices her too.
Oh i forgot to mention that the fairy godmother told her that she hadta be home by midnight.
Or otherwise the pumpkin carriage would disappear.
She would be back in her poor clothes that she would had before.
At the ball they announce that the the prince is going to marry whoever's shoe will fit into a glass slipper.
Everybody's trying to figure what size their feet are.
Whether they will fit in this glass slipper.
Well some how or other cinderella ends up with it at home.
She she had it just as she turned midnight or something.
So the wicked stepsisters try it on.
It does not fit them at all.
But lo and behold it actually fits cinderella.
She puts it on.
She goes to meet the prince.
So they live happily ever after.
Okay we had a little girl and her dog who would been out in the yard playing.
She notices her cat is in the tree.
I suppose the man in the tree was her father who came running because he wanted to see that that cat got safely down.
Or maybe it was a neighbor who came to rescue the cat.
But onced he got into the tree the ladder that he climbed into the tree fell over.
Now not only is the cat stranded but the neighbor who came to rescue the cat is stranded in the tree.
Someone else has called the firemen.
The and there is already a rescue on the way.
For the end of the story of course they rescued the man and the cat.
The dog becomes settled down.
Well to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you first hafta find out the preference of peanut butter and the preference of jelly for the person you are fixing the sandwich for.
Sometimes there is even a preference for what kind of bread you put it on.
Some people prefer a lot of jam.
Some people prefer only jelly and a very little of it.
Some people prefer crunchy peanut butter.
Some people prefer smooth.
Some people hafta have jif or they will not do.
So you get all your three things together.
You are and with the knife just spread the peanut butter and the jelly.
Some people want jelly rubbed on both pieces of bread and then jelly in between.
Some people just want peanut butter on one side.
So you spread the peanut butter and then the jelly or the other way around.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I was planning for this to be a very innocent thing.
Ah i found that so interesting that the thing that came to them immediately was something past that had been very sad.
I found out that was not an innocent question to ask.
Something important that happened in my life okay.
Something important happened in my life.
The probably the thing that is most important is the man i married that i love.
That probably is very important because i grew up on a farm in kentucky.
When i met ken i found out there were another family maybe just a lot like my family at the other end of the state.
He would also grown up on a farm.
So we understood each other very well.
So the things that make us happy are in general just having a little bit of extra money to do the things we want make us happy.
It does not take much to make us happy because we still just kind of go back to our background.
There were eleven.
He probably needed all the affection i was useta giving to younger siblings.
My being the oldest i needed maybe some of the protection that he gives because he did not really like being in that large of crowd that much.
He kind of liked having some time all to himself.
So i have had some protection from from heck overcommitting to be that person who is going to help everybody because he does not particularly like all that group activity.
We have raised two daughters of our own and a foster child.
We have a a young boy.
He is just needing some alone time.
It broke the window of his home.
The ball comes into the house where the father is sitting trying to rest from his hard day of work.
Now dad hasta decide whether he can overcome his frustration at at this new procedure of events or if he needs to comfort a son who is overly sensitive and does not take well to discipline.
It is raining outside.
You must take this umbrella.
The child insists that he does not need an umbrella.
Off he goes to school.
By the time he gets home again he is very wet and chilled and tired.
But the next time it is raining he gets his umbrella.
Know that happened too.
But she seems to be in a very fast moving stream of water and danger of not being able to save herself.
So we have someone who is been called to rescue.
This rescuer is being very brave risking his own life with only a limb of a tree it appears to hold onto as he tries to reach out and rescue this young lady.
Okay cinderella as a young child had lost her mother.
So he married this woman.
Mama already had two daughters.
She much preferred them and preferred to use whatever assets she hadta benefit her own children.
Thought that cinderella needed to be in the servant role.
How much of that she did in front of her father i do not know.
But for the most part cinderella's life was bringing the tea and the cookies and mopping the floor.
In the walt disney version of this story there are lots of mice.
I wonder how the mice got into that story.
We need somebody to put together that gown later do not we.
As cinderella growing up though her fantasy is to someday get to go maybe at least to see the palace where the king lives.
Then as the girls were all grown the invitation comes to a big party palace.
So maybe from all of the girls that get to go there will be a bride chosen.
Cinderella is helping them get ready but has no gown of her own nor any way to get to the ball herself because stepmother of course is not a bit interested in her getting to go to the ball.
It seems to me that mama maybe even dressed and went to the ball herself too.
Got to oversee this that the girls meet all the proper people.
So after they leave for the ball it just so happens these mice have gotten together and made a gown.
A fairy godmother comes along.
Helps provide transportation and footmen to carry cinderella to the ball and perhaps a little instruction on how to meet properly the people in high of society.
So cinderbrella cinderella turns up at the ball in her the prettiest of all dresses and shoes and handbag and head adornment.
She first of all hasta adhere instruction from the fairy godmother to make sure she gets home by midnight because the chariot has been made from a pumpkin and it will return to a pumpkin.
The footmen will return to being mice at midnight.
So she arrives castle.
Actually has the privilege of meeting the prince.
The prince is very taken with her.
At the last minute she notices that it is approaching midnight.
I believe the clock may have already stroke one and she realizes she must leave.
As she is leaving she drops a glass slipper.
The prince finds the slipper but he cannot find the girl because she is hadta return home.
I do not know what at what point her chariot actually turned back to a pumpkin whether it was after she arrived at home or whether she was on the road and hadta make her way back home all by herself.
Of course the sisters and the mom came home.
They would all had a wondrous time.
All the talk was about the the lovely young woman who had gone off and left her glass slipper.
The prince was now going to be coming to find the lady trying on that shoe on every woman in the country until he could find the woman who owned that slipper.
So stepmother began to concoct that somehow those shoes would fit her daughters.
When the prince arrived at their door they did try on the shoe.
The her own daughters the stepsister's foot would not fit into that shoe.
When cinderella stepped out with the match to the shoe then there was havoc because the prince had found his bride.
The stepmother found her comeuppatence because now her underling daughter stepdaughter was going to get to be the queen.
She was going to get to be nobody.
Well the first thing that happened was the cat got up in a tree.
Got stuck and could not come down again.
So the people were trying to come over and help her down.
Little girl is down down the ground calling to the cat pleading it to jump off and come on down to her.
But the cat will not do that.
Daddy he got the ladder out.
He got up on the tree.
The his ladder fell down so he all he hadta do was sit there.
The dog is down below the tree barking barking up the tree probably to see dad went.
And the firemen came with their ladder.
Looks like they are going to save the father and the cat.
There is a bird on the side just just acting like a bird.
That is about all i can do make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
First i would find out if i had all the ingredients there which i usually do.
So then i would go over and get a paper towel.
By that time i would have the peanut butter and jelly all ready to go.
On top of the bread i would put the peanut butter first.
Then i would put the jelly on.
After that i would go to the sink.
Well happy or sad let us see.
A long time ago i would say about fifty years ago we had our first child in a hospital.
My wife become overdue so we hadta go to the hospital.
She had that by natural birth.
They just had birth induction or whatever they call it.
We were there for some time trying to get that started.
We were doing fine until little later on in the evening another woman with her girl came in.
We were doing fine.
She started to scream and holler and scream and holler.
And so my wife thought that was pretty nice to do.
So she starts screaming and hollering screaming and hollering.
I asked the nurse.
The nurse says.
A little sideline to the story that nurse was a nurse that i went with in high school.
I had not seen her for about ten years until i met her in the hospital that night.
Then the baby was born.
She was put in the room with with with oh probably six or so other other women.
Everybody looked at the baby.
Then we came out of the hospital about about three days later.
Later fifty eight years later the nurse in the hospital that i useta go with was in my senior class so my wife met her fifty eight years later.
So i guess those were all good times.
Little boy's outside playing kickball with his soccer ball.
He was kicking it up in the air.
One time went a little too far.
He put the ball through the window.
As the ball came in the ball hit the lamp.
Then the father picked up the ball.
Saw the boy or not but he tried to figure out where the ball came from.
His mother wanted to give him an umbrella.
But he waved his hand and did not like it.
So he waved goodbye to her.
The mommy still wanted to give him the umbrella.
But she she kept it.
He started walking to school.
It started to rain.
It started raining real hard.
So he turned around and ran home.
He came in home.
His mother looked kind of disgusted because he was all wet.
But he must have gotten all dried off and started back to school with the umbrella and and kept dry.
The creek started to rise.
She got out there.
Got in trouble because she could not swim very well.
This rescue fella must be from the rescue wagon he tried to go over and and pull her on out of there.
He got out to a limb in the creek.
They both got in trouble.
The the the water was so fast that it kind of swept them both away.
They caught on to a branch.
The rescue fella got his belt buckle and belt belt around the arm of the girl.
And they were both holding on to the branch.
I guess that is a story to be continued.
Anyway cinderella was living in this house with a lady that had her other daughters.
One day they were invited to a ball to dance and have a good time.
The mother wanted the daughters to go.
But they did not want cinderella to go because she was not did not think they were that pretty or that cleaned up or anything.
So they got themselves all dressed up in their finery.
They took off for the ball.
Well cinderella she found a dress to wear also.
But she was told by maybe godmother or something that she should go to the ball.
And then she went to the ball.
I did not see in the storyboard that they told her to be home at a certain time but i believe that is the way the story was.
Anyway she went to the ball.
The prince is was dancing with ththem all the girls.
He thought she was pretty attractive so he started to dance with her.
Then all of a sudden she realized she hadta leave.
At that time she ran away.
Somebody at the ball found it.
They i guess they gave it to the prince.
He was going to go find out who who lost their shoe so he could see them again.
When they got to the house the the the mother she thought the daughters oughta try the shoe on.
And it did not fit of course.
It fit.
I guess they lived happily ever after.
The little girl's cat is needing rescued.
Apparently her dad or big brother climbed up in the tree on the ladder.
The ladder has fallen.
It is laying back out in the yard.
Course the dog is concerned.
He is barking.
They are going to rescue the man and the cat i hope.
We get in to the car.
I said.
Because she was going to take a little trip to nashville to visit a cousin in her the dorm and all that stuff.
I said.
It is got air conditioners and yours does not.
You might need it.
So so i have her car.
We get in the car.
We start from home.
We get less than half a mile when a a fellow that shoulda been arrested for d u i had not been yet.
He comes runs off the road comes back on hits us head on.
Well my daughter and i were the two that were hurt the most.
Between us they said we had forty three pints of blood before we quit leaking.
But the the process through that it took us as the emergency crew was talking.
There was two different emergency rescue trucks there.
They said.
Well we had better go to two different emergency rooms because they need both staffs.
So one of the comments that was made at the hospital where i went was that i had too many doctors.
Well my wife lee hadta kind of monitor that progress.
There was medications they were giving me ten days later that shoulda been stopped after twenty four hours and things like that.
So if she had not been on it well i do not know what would have happened.
When she just kind of spent seem like twenty four hours a day trying to make me comfortable bebecause i was unconscious for three days.
Then i after after a couple of days i sent to therapy.
Then i had a blood clot.
We wrestled that total of forty some days plus another long recovery home.
I keep afraid that i will forget how what i owe her.
This little boy is it appears to be a soccer ball he is out in the yard kicking.
It comes flying through the air.
It comes through the window.
And the i see glass on the floor.
The last picture is the gentleman who had been sitting by that table lamp has got the ball in his hand.
He is looking out the window.
I do not know what he is saying.
It is not nice i do not think.
Okay i see a little girl here with her backpack on.
She must be headed to school.
Her mother thinks she should have an umbrella.
No she does not need an umbrella.
So mother still has it.
She goes out the door.
The rain starts falling.
Now she is i believe she is decided to go back.
She is nice and wet as she goes.
But she goes out the door again.
She has the umbrella over her head.
Seems like she is keeping her dry this time.
I see here flood waters.
I see probably the little girl that is kind of hanging on to a tree limb.
The boy with the lifejacket on on a rescue team bebecause he seems to be better equipped.
We do not see dry ground yet so they still have some opportunity ahead of ththem.
That is all i see.
We have a piece of brown bread.
The there is only one piece of bread so we are going to make a half a peanut butter jelly sandwich.
We do not have a knife so we are probably going to just use our fingers to spread the peanut butter and to spread the jelly on.
Then we will fold it over and have us a half peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well cinderella was a little girl living with this family that had two daughters.
They were going to let her do a lot of the especially the servant work.
She wanted to go too.
Oh no she could not go.
She hadta stay home and work.
But the two sisters were going to go.
But somehow she is in the attic and finds this trunk and she is reading and she discovers.
I kept looking for the fairy godmother that was going to come by did not find it in that book.
She is showed how she can dress and get.
There is going to be a carriage with horses.
Believe this carriage is made out of a big pumpkin that is going to ball.
So she gets there.
Course she is just striking.
He just but there is a little problem.
When the clock strikes twelve if she is not back home carriage and everything turn back into a pumpkin.
This glass slipper that she was wearing falls off.
She gets back home.
He finally finds her.
He puts it back on her foot.
They were off to happy happy ever after i think.
A little girl is riding her tricycle with her cat.
A dog comes and chases the cat up a tree.
She goes and finds a man to get the cat down out of the tree.
He brings a ladder and climbs into the tree.
But the ladder falls down.
The firemen are called.
First i would get a piece of bread the peanut butter and jelly.
I would first spread the bread with peanut butter.
Probably the best time i have had for the last few years is the three trips that we have hadta england.
You know we i would never been overseas except once.
We enjoyed ththem very much.
We got to see a lot of the english countryside and london.
That is that is the best time we have had in the last few years.
Okay the little boy is playing in the yard kicking the soccer ball.
He suddenly kicks it.
It goes through the window.
His father is sitting in the chair by the window.
The ball comes through the window and knocks over the lamp.
The father gets up.
Looks out through the broken window to see what has happened.
His mother offers him the umbrella.
But he says that he does not need it.
He leaves.
As he starts his walk to school it starts to rain.
He turns around.
She gives him back the umbrella.
He starts back to school.
A girl is trapped in the rising water.
The rescue squad is called.
A man with a lifejacket and safety belts gets to the tree to make a rescue.
Okay cinderella was an orphan girl who was forced to work for her wicked stepmother who had two daughters.
She was forced to scrub the floors and wait on the daughters.
She dreamed of being a princess.
While she was dreaming of being a princess her stepdaughters were sent an invitation to go to the the prince's party.
Cinderella was not invited.
But she she dreamed of going.
She met her fairy godmother who granted her wish and provided her with clothes and a coach to ride to the party.
Her stepsisters were upset that she was going to the party and tried to stop ththem.
But she went and met the prince.
He was very taken with her.
Wanted her to stay and dance with him.
But she saw that it was midnight and she needed to return.
So she ran down the steps.
She lost her glass slipper on the way down the stairs.
The prince looked and looked to try her.
He came to her house and tried the slipper on.
And her sisters tried the slipper on and it would not fit.
But he finally saw cinderella.
Found that the slipper fit her.
Okay the beginning is the dog has chased the cat up the tree obviously.
So the father gets up in the tree with a ladder.
Thinks he is going to save the cat.
The ladder falls.
There is no way he can reach that kitty cat.
So they called the fire department to come get the the cat out of the tree and the man out of the tree of course.
I would imagine the end is they rescue the man and they rescue the cat.
The little bird over here just really does not care.
First i would get out good creamy jiff peanut butter good homemade blackberry jam or grape jam.
Then i would get out whole wheat bread of course because it is healthier.
I would spread the peanut butter on one piece of the bread.
Then i would take the jelly that is homemade and made thinner so it does not move your peanut butter around.
I would spread the jelly on that.
My daughter worked for uk.
She was having the baby at at u k hospital.
I do not remember the doctor's name but we liked him.
She was the last baby he delivered at uk because he was going to the baby hospital.
I do not know what it is bebecause i only come to uk.
But he left.
They put her in the the big birthing room and all this.
So i got to watch.
The baby's dad got to be there.
I was trying to get up to where i could see.
I thought i was going to hafta just knock a nurse out of the way bebecause i could not see what i wanted to see.
So we went there like six that morning because they induced labor.
She was born about seven that evening.
So he is kicking that soccer ball.
It goes through a window.
Who is sitting there but probably the father.
So the soccer ball comes in.
Into the the father catches the soccer ball.
Knows what has happened.
There is really not an ending.
His mother says.
It is going to be raining.
You better take the umbrella.
I guess he says.
No it is not going to rain.
So he goes.
Course the rain starts.
He is getting soaked.
So then he goes back to the house.
He is all soaking wet.
His mother sees him.
She gives him an umbrella.
She has fallen in cannot get out.
The fireman is trying to save her.
He is got a belt that he is trying to get to put around her so he could pull her to safety.
I imagine he does rescue her.
But you cannot tell by this one picture.
But he is he is attempting to rescue her from the swollen stream.
Cinderella lives with her father.
He remarries.
She hasta go live with the stepmother and the two beautiful daughters.
And they make her clean and they make her work.
So she is not treated well.
There is a big ball going to be at the castle.
They get to go the ball.
But she cannot go because she hasta stay and work.
She is having to work.
She is cleaning and all.
The fairy godmother i remember she comes in and talks to to cinderella.
Says that she is going to get her a dress and get her some glass slippers.
She is going to go to the ball.
So she gets her all dressed up.
She wears her glass slippers and she goes to the ball.
At midnight she is still at the ball which she should be out in the carriage going back home.
She realizes that she stayed too long.
So she runs out of the castle.
They take her home.
So then the prince saw her.
He wants to know who wore the glass slipper bebecause he kind of liked her.
So he is searching to see who can wear the glass slipper who it fits.
The pretty girls tried it on.
It did not fit either one of them.
So they decided they would try it on cinderella.
So she lived happy ever after.
Molly is crying about her cat being in a tree.
The cat was in the tree because it was chased by marley the dog.
Daddy powell came out to try to rescue the cat.
He was caught on the branch in the tree.
He could not reach the cat.
The cat would not jump down to molly.
Someone called the fire department.
Hopefully they will get daddy down.
Hopefully they will coax the kitty cat down.
Enjoying all of this is a little bird sitting on a branch singing his heart out.
You want your bread good and soft but not too soft.
Well one of the happiest experiences in my life was when i got married.
I i really did not anticipate getting married young.
I had lots of dreams about going to college and becoming a teacher.
My parents were older people when i was born.
I i was going to take care of my parents.
But my brother had a friend it was world war two and this friend was home on leave from the navy.
He and my brother were palling around together.
He seemed to be attracted to me.
But i did not recognize it at the time.
After the war was over and he was released from service he came to our house to pal around with my brother again.
He asked me to go on a skating date with him.
My brother and his girlfriend were going to be going along.
Because i was young my father would not let me go on a date alone.
So for a number of dates we date double dated with my brother and his girlfriend.
But after that first skating date my to be husband had told me.
Someday i am going to marry you.
Well i said to him.
You just think you are.
However as time went on number of months later he asked me to marry him.
I said.
My parents thought i was too young.
But they recognized that because i was the youngest of eight children and had more responsibilities than most people at that stage of life they thought it would work out okay.
It did.
Matthew was kicking his soccer ball around.
He would been told to not kick it towards anyone's house.
However as typical matthew did not listen.
He kicked the soccer ball.
It entered broke entered the window of mister mccord.
Mister mccord goes to the window and no doubt yells at matthew.
Okay matthew's getting ready to go to school.
Momma martin says.
Matthew it is going to rain today.
You needta take an umbrella.
Matthew says.
Oh i do not need an umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
If it rains i will be alright.
Matthew starts towards the school bus.
Starts raining.
I should have listened.
I will take the umbrella.
I will go to the school bus now.
He walks to the school bus.
Okay helen was driving down a a a highway to rural kentucky.
It had been raining hard.
People had been warned about flooding.
If you came to a road with water on it to not try to go through.
Helen did not listen.
She tried to plow through the water.
Her car was swept into the raging creek.
A brave fireman named mike came to the rescue.
Reach into the raging water which helen held onto.
I am sure she is grateful the rest of her life for being rescued by fireman mike.
Once upon a time there was a wealthy businessman who had become a widow.
He had a lovely little girl named cinderella.
He fortunately realized that she needed a mother.
So he remarried.
He married a lady that had two two daughters also.
When the businessman was off and away the stepmother and her daughters enjoyed their new lifestyle.
But they did not care much for cinderella.
She was assigned household chores that kept her pretty busy and out of the way.
But as time went on in the country where they lived the the king had a good looking son who was a prince that was to the age time when he should marry and perhaps start a family.
The king said to his son.
I want you to find a wife.
In order to find a wife he was going to have a ball.
The prince would choose one.
Well this story was gladly accepted by cinderella's stepmother.
Of course she wanted her two daughters to be part of that ensemble of young ladies looking for a good time at the ball and being there for the prince to perhaps choose one of them.
They talked about how they were going to dress.
When they were going to go.
When cinderella overheard this story she also wanted to go.
Stepmother said.
You cannot go.
So the the stepdaughters stepsisters made themselves beautiful.
Yet she came upon a way to go to the ball.
She was reading a book about magic.
She made a wish from reading the book.
She wished for a fairy godmother.
Fairy godmother came.
Yes you can go to the ball.
She helped cinderella by having her dress in a beautiful outfit.
The stepsisters got became aware of this.
They tried to keep cinderella from going.
But the fairy godmother made sure that she could go.
She made sure that there was a a carriage to take her take cinderella to the ball.
Cinderella went to the ball was not recognized by her stepsisters.
She was having a great time.
Now cinderella had been told by the fairy godmother that she hadta be home by midnight.
Cinderella was having such a good time she almost forgot about it.
Yet when the clock started striking midnight twelve of the clock she ran from the ball to the carriage.
On the way she lost a slipper.
We have been told it was a glass slipper.
She got home okay.
Meanwhile the prince found the slipper.
So he told his father.
The person that wears this this slipper is the one i want to marry.
I hafta find out where she lives.
So the king sent out word to the entire community.
My my son will will find the owner of this glass slipper.
She will become his bride.
Going from place to place when the prince came upon the home of cinderella her stepmother and stepsisters he tried the slipper on the stepsisters.
It did not fit.
He asked if anyone else was there another female.
Of course they said.
But then he found out that cinderella was there.
He asked her to try on the slipper.
She tried it on.
It fit.
He took her as his bride.
They lived happily ever after.
I remember this as an exercise the kids hadta do in school.
Well you would go to the kitchen where the supplies are.
You would get out the bread and peanut butter and jelly whatever you wanted to put on it.
Spread the peanut butter and whatever else you are going to put on it on the bread.
Looks like the little girl's kitty got up in the tree.
She did not know what to do.
So she called for her father.
He came out to go up in the tree and get the kitten.
He had brought the ladder out to get out in the tree.
But unfortunately the ladder fell.
The dog got upset because he saw the man up in the tree.
The little girl was crying and more worried about the cat than she was her father.
Somebody must have seen the dilemma and called the firemen to come to the rescue.
About something that happened in my life.
All my children had moved.
Nobody lived where i lived anymore in topeka.
I had grandchildren in kentucky that were growing up.
All i had was a job and a house there.
So i decided to move to kentucky.
So it a decision to be made to get rid of the house and your security.
So i got a job before i came.
I got a good job.
At i moved here.
Hadta get rid of a lot of stuff and sell my house.
Because they wanted me to get here.
Did not get my house sold.
Finally my house sold.
When i moved into an apartment.
When it was up i i bought a house.
Was really happy with where i was working and it got to see my grand children grow up.
The older they get the further they get.
He kicks it into a window.
There is a gentleman sitting in the house.
The ball comes through the broken window.
It surprises him scares him.
He grabs the ball and stands up and looks out to see who might have done this.
She is trying to get him to take an umbrella.
Nope i do not want it.
I do not need it.
So he just waves behind.
He is all happy that he won did not hafta take the umbrella.
He gets on the way to school.
It starts pouring down rain.
So he turns around and splashes back home.
His mother's not happy bebecause he is soaked.
He is not happy because he is soaked.
So he is looks like he musta changed his clothes because he looks dry in the next picture.
It is still pouring down rain.
But now he is taking the umbrella.
It kind of looks like there is flood water.
Somebody a woman has gotten in trouble and is in the flood water.
They are making an attempt to rescue her.
There is a gentleman or a a rescuer fireman or something with proper gear and some kind of a line or something.
I cannot tell if that is a tree or whatever.
He is trying to reach her.
It looks like it is going to be a a successful recovery.
Unless something breaks or the man loses hold.
He has on a lifejacket.
But she does not.
I do not know what the end is.
The king is looking for a wife for the prince.
So they decide to have a ball.
The word goes out.
I do not know how she got there.
Just shows her in a fancy dress one day and scullery maid the next.
But anyway the two stepsisters are making plans to go and dress and etcetera.
Cinderella wants to go.
But she does not really have a dress.
But it shows the mice there.
It does not really show ththem making the dress.
But i am thinking that she and the mice make the dress.
They see cinderella dressed up.
They ruin her dress.
Then her fairy godmother comes and takes her little stick and makes a beautiful dress for cinderella.
Cinderella goes to the ball.
There is a carriage that takes her with horses.
When she is leaving she loses her shoe.
So the prince is looking for the woman who is foot fits in the shoe.
Tries it on and it fits.
They leave in a carriage.
The little girl's cat climbed up in a tree and could not get back down.
So her father decided to help her.
He went and got a ladder and climbed up into the tree.
Somehow while he was in the tree the ladder fell down.
So someone saw this and called the fire department.
The fire department came with their ladder and to rescue the father and the cat up in the tree.
Dog was at the base of the tree barking up at the man and the cat all the while.
Okay you get two slices of bread and a jar of peanut butter and some jelly and a knife.
You spread the peanut butter on one piece of the bread evenly all over it.
You put the jelly on the other piece of the bread.
You put the two together then.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
A say that again now.
Well i do not know.
I i guess i i am glad i got the woman i did ta marry.
Well me met in a theater when i was probably a freshman in high school.
We went to different high schools.
But i met her there.
Then we began dating in high school.
Then i went away to college and for three years.
Then then we got married between my junior and senior year of college.
She went back with me.
She went to two years of college at a junior college.
So then we got married and went back and spent the last year for me to graduate.
Okay the first story is that the kid's out kicking a soccer ball.
He kicks it through the window of a house.
The dad picks up the ball looks out the window.
To see where the ball came from.
He has a backpack on.
His mother comes out to.
She has an umbrella in her hand.
He leaves with the umbrella although i do not see it.
But apparently she gives him the umbrella.
He takes off down the road.
Pretty soon it begins raining.
No he did not take it with him.
He he he left without the umbrella.
It started raining.
Then he ran back home.
Well this looks like that a lady had in some way fallen inta flooding creek or river.
The rescue guy was trying to rescue her.
He had a lifejacket on.
He was trying to go out and rescue her apparently.
There was going to be a ball where the prince was coming to the ball.
That was back in the days when england had kings and princes and this type of thing.
Cinderella being the youngest could not go to the ball.
But her two older sisters were going to go.
And she wanted to go to the ball really bad.
But she she was told she could not go.
Then this god fairy appeared to her.
And told her that she could go to the ball.
So he do magic put her in a a party dress.
So she went to the ball.
It the god fairy told her that she must be home by the strike of twelve or she would turn into something.
But she hadta be back by twelve.
So she went to the ball.
While she was at the ball she was noticed by the prince.
And they danced together and had a wonderful time.
He when when she realized it was twelve of the clock she hadta run to go home.
In the process of trying to run home to get home before twelve she lost one of her slippers.
The she barely did make it home before twelve.
The next day the prince wanted to find out who this young lady was that he would danced with at the ball.
And nobody knew who it was or what her name was.
So he had the shoe.
So he started going around the countryside looking for some young lady who that shoe would fit.
So he went around and finally found cinderella.
Of course the shoe fit her perfectly.
She ended up marrying the prince.
When their dog got out of the house.
The cat ran up the tree.
Sally summoned her dad.
So dad put a short ladder up on the tree.
But the dog knocked the ladder down.
Sally told her mother.
Who called the fire department.
Who rushes to rescue dad.
Who looks mighty foolish.
Well to make a good peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need seedless jewish rye bread.
You need very creamy peanut butter which should be smeared thickly on one side.
On the other piece of bread you should use marmalade.
American marmalade has too much sugar in it.
You should put the two together.
I cut it across for myself bias for my wife.
I do not quite understand why.
But that is the way they do it in the south.
You should then proceed to eat the peanut butter sandwich.
The second world war was drawing to a close.
The atomic bomb had been dropped on hiroshima.
That is all trivial i rushed to answer the phone.
I picked it up and heard my father is say.
I heard my grandfather say.
That really struck me.
As it turned out it became even more complicated.
My uncle had been killed as we found out later in a plane crash in mexico.
There are two volcanos.
One well known popocatepetl.
Then the other the sleeping maiden.
It took two more than two weeks for the climbing party to get up to determine if anyone had survived.
None had not survived unfortunately.
So but i remember with being with my father at various waiting to find out about this.
They only separated by eleven months in age.
My father and mother hadta go down to mexico.
In those days you went by train.
The war time which you probably cannot appreciate today what it was like back then.
They did bring them all back.
I remember it distinctly.
I can still see the large dark wood coffin which was set in my grandparents' house in the living room.
Unopened because my uncle of course hadta be cremated.
Put in a lil silver urn which you put in the casket.
Believed that everybody get buried in a coffin.
That was the first death i have experienced as a child.
It had a very marked effect on me.
I remember it all very clear.
All i could almost tell you verbatim what people said.
A young boy is practicing playing soccer.
He miskicks.
And it fall goes and breaks the window of his house.
Bounces into the living room knocking a lamp over where his father is sitting.
The father picks up the soccer ball.
Calls for the little boy to come and explain.
His mother wants him to take an umbrella because she fears the weather will change.
He assures her that nothing of that sort is going to happen.
She retains the umbrella.
He walks out.
It immediately begins to rain.
He turns around in the rain runs back in and stands there in front of his mother dripping wet.
She then gives him the umbrella.
He takes off again.
I want to skip.
She is been clinging to a rather small tree.
With a lifejacket on and a safety belt has gone out to rescue her holding onto the tree.
He has taken a another belt to put around her and attach her to himself.
Hopefully he will then take her back to shore.
It will end happily.
Or the tree will break which is very small.
They will both drown.
Cinderella's father is cinderella's mother having died has taken a new wife.
Who also has two daughters.
He being a merchant hasta travel frequently and is away from home most of the time.
Cinderella does not get on well with her stepmother who is a very unpleasant woman as are her stepsisters.
The stepsisters reduce cinderella to little more than a servant.
It turns out that the prince of the kingdom.
They need an heir.
Consequently they are going to have a great big ball with all the young women of the kingdom coming to be reviewed by the prince.
Meanwhile the stepsisters are getting gussied up for this.
Their mother having bought them nice gowns.
Fortunately for cinderella she has some small animal friends who make her a beautiful ball gown.
But she lacks transportation and shoes.
Then lo and behold her fairy godmother appears.
But she says be back by the last stroke of midnight because everything will change back.
So she goes to the ball.
He spends all the time with her much to the frustration of the two stepsisters and their mother.
At just as she is really enjoying herself she hears the clock start to chime twelve.
So she rushes away from him down the steps very rapidly and loses one of the slippers.
Coach takes off and almost home it turns back into a pumpkin and rats etcetera.
The prince wants to marry this young woman.
He tells his father.
I have found the the love of my life.
So he sends out messengers all over the kingdom because he has the glass slipper.
Whoever fits into this glass slipper bebecause it is rather small is going to be my wife.
So everyone tries to get in the glass slipper.
Finally they come to the cinderella's house where her stepsisters all try to jam their feet into the glass slipper.
Some even bending their shoe feet double to get in.
But it fails.
The officer of the search says.
There are no other young woman in the house?
But they hafta try it on her.
They try it on.
It fits.
She is taken back to the palace.
Everybody lives happily ever after bebecause she marries the prince.
Except in the true german version of this where she has her two stepsisters and stepmother put to death.
Well there is a cat that is gone up a tree.
After a bird evidently bebecause there is a bird sitting there.
The little girl is trying to get the cat down with her tricycle.
The dog is trying to climb the tree.
Two firemen are running across with a ladder.
They go up the ladder and get the.
The ladder has fallen that the husband climbed up in.
So they bring in a ladder and so forth to get the cat out of the tree.
Alrightie first you got to get the bread out.
Some people prefer it toasted.
Some do not like it toasted.
Sometimes i do both.
You put the two pieces back together.
You start chomping.
When growing up i did not like people.
I i i just could not stand people.
I i was was getting in fights and everything.
During the summer i would go a a week and do her grass cutting and painting painting and everything.
So when i was eleven years old i was went to bed that night.
I laid there all night awake.
I i did not like what was going on.
So i decided.
When i wake up tomorrow i am going to be the best guy in the world.
And i am going to love everybody.
So next morning i woke up.
I became a nut really.
I i i went to junior high school.
I got this this buddy of.
I started you know acting trying to make people laugh.
So i had a buddy that had an uncle who was a nut.
They called him jabbo.
So we started a jabbo club in junior high.
Noone knew my name real name i do not think.
But i been pretty well the same ever since.
You know just try to find the good good side of things.
And that is that jabbo's what i used on the t v show.
I would dress up like frankenstein and call it jabbo the singing monster.
I have done a bunch of t v shots with that.
The little boy playing outside.
He kicks the soccer ball.
It goes through a window of a house.
Breaks the glass and goes into a house where a man is sitting in a chair evidently watching t v or whatever.
He picks the ball up.
He looks out the through the broken window to see where it came from.
So evidently it is raining outside.
He is got his backpack.
So his mother hands him an umbrella.
He said.
He does not need the umbrella.
His his mother keeps it.
He goes out into the rain.
On the way to school he the rain started to get a little heavier.
He is covering up his head.
To and all soaking wet.
This last picture his mother has given hi am his umbrella again.
He is using it this time.
He is going back to school.
Some lady is fell in the water.
He is got his harness and everything.
He is got his lifejacket on.
Looks like he is pretty well on the way to saving her.
I think.
They mistreated her and made her do this housework.
But then she was not included in activities.
Finally they sent her off to work in a castle.
They the of course the the mean sisters stepmother did not like it.
So anyway they wind up the the fairy godmother whatever she was is she.
It appears a young child has lost her cat up a tree.
She is asked for helped from apparently from her father who is now stuck in the tree trying to get the cat.
Somehow or another they have called the fire department who is arriving with a ladder.
I do not know whether to get the cat or the man.
My first wife died a number of years ago.
I within a year or so i started dating again.
I have remarried.
It is what started out pretty tragically has turned out quite well.
He manages to kick it right into the man's living room.
It looks like he is conviscating the soccer ball.
Momma says.
You better take an umbrella.
It is going to rain.
He says.
I do not need the umbrella.
Then of course it starts raining.
He turns around and goes back.
Pretty disgusted mom but she gives hi am the umbrella.
Off he goes to school.
Cinderella's father has apparently been widowed.
They they never get along.
The mother thinks cinderella oughta be her servant.
The the ugly stepsisters of course soon pick up on that.
They think she oughta be her their servant.
This goes on for years.
As they get older the the prince of the land is time to be married.
So he invites all the people in the land to a big ball.
The stepmother and her daughters have spend hours days getting prepared for this.
Cinderella's not been invited.
The as the ball approaches the stepsisters go off to the ball.
Cinderella's left at home without anything.
An comes up with a big beautiful gown for cinderella to wear.
She goes to the ball.
Coach and horses that cinderella has is that at midnight she must leave.
When midnight comes she is not ready to leave.
But she does.
In the process of her hurry to get out of there loses one of her glass slippers.
They the prince spends time going throughout the kingdom and finally finds cinderella.
The one who fits the slipper.
After the ugly stepdaughters were sure it was going to be them.
So cinderella wins her prince.
I usually would open the peanut butter jar.
I got myself a sandwich.
The looks like this man has gotten a ladder to go up and rescue the cat.
But the ladder's fallen over.
The dog may have knocked the ladder over.
It is hard to say how the ladder fell over.
But the dog is now barking at the man up the tree.
The fire department is coming with a new ladder to rescue them all.
There is a bird off to the right singing as if he is oblivious to anything else that is happening.
She lived in an apartment.
Periodically when i would stop over there we would talk or visit.
We would go for a long walks.
One evening we went for a long walk at a a park near her house.
We would just walk and talk for a long time.
We sat down.
Decided that is what we would do and probably.
Okay there's a boy playing soccer.
Startles the man sitting in the chair in the room.
He picks up the ball.
Then looks out the window to see where it came from.
A young boy is leaving to go to school probably with his pack.
Mother encourages him to take the umbrella.
He refuses it almost smilingly laughing.
There is no problem.
The rain gets harder.
When you are ready i want you to tell me the story you see in the picture.
Maybe because of the rain and the erosion slipped and fell into the river.
The someone saw her holding onto the branch.
A the rescue team has put on a lifejacket.
He is wearing a big heavy belt which may be tied to some kind of a rope to pull him back.
Okay the new stepmother arrives with her two daughters.
The father's introducing the girls to his daughter cinderella.
They are then shown in the book as growing up.
The cinderella's taking the role of the servant.
The there is a scene which the king tells probably the prime minister or something that they needta do something about getting the prince married.
So they announce a a ball.
The girls are all planning to go to the ball.
Cinderella in this book evidently opens up a chest and finds a ball gown and maybe a diary or something of her mother's.
I do not remember that as being part of the story as i recall it.
But that is what seems to be in the book.
But when she gets dressed everybody rejects the idea that she can go.
She stays home.
The fairy godmother arrives and arranges for her to go.
Gets an even more beautiful dress for her to to wear.
Stories i remembered always had the carriage that was generated from a pumpkin that she goes in.
I do not even remember seeing that in the book.
She goes to the ball.
She is makes a hit with the prince.
But she hasta leave at midnight.
She is got the instructions to leave at midnight.
Otherwise she will her return to the clothes she was wearing before she got the ball dress.
The carriage will turn into a pumpkin.
She races out of the ball before try to get home before midnight.
The prince is left having no idea where to find this young woman that he is become entranced with when he has only the shoe.
They put out a proclamation that it the shoe should be taken throughout the kingdom until they find what who it fits.
Then they get to the home of cinderella.
Everyone tries it on.
But it fits cinderella to the horror of the stepdaughters.
Cinderella marries the prince.
The first thing i would do is i would get the bread out of the breadbox.
I would have two slices.
I would lay ththem on the counter.
I would get the jelly out out of the refrigerator.
I would get the peanut butter out from our lazy susan.
I would spread the peanut butter on the bread first.
Then i would put the jelly on top of it.
Then i would fold one piece of bread on ta top of the other one.
A lil girl her cat's climbed up a tree.
She cannot get him back down.
So she runs home.
She gets her dad.
Her dad comes back.
He gets a ladder.
He gets up on the tree.
The dog knocks the ladder down from the tree.
A fire truck is going by.
Two firemen run out with their ladder and they say.
Well we will hafta rectify the situation.
Well one of my favorite stories that i tell all the time is that when i was growing up in cincinnati.
They had laws about drinking beer there.
I mean they had three two beer and six percent beer.
There was a little place out in the country called pop cassidy's where he served us beer when we were just fourteen years old ya know.
We went out there.
We were playing a pinball machine.
We were playing it for a couple of hours.
We said.
This is boring now.
Let us do something exciting.
So they said.
Well okay let us go out to the old haunted obsorbatory.
Now this is an observatory to study the stars.
Cincinnati has a very famous observatory called dle adler observatory i think.
They have just built this as a work project administration project just just some place to get ththem to do it.
So i mean it was immediately after the war.
They said.
We do not need two of these things.
So they abandoned it.
It grew out with weeds and things like that.
Kids useta go out there and neck.
They useta smoke not cigarettes.
They did not smoke pot in those days.
So we got there first.
We parked our car alongside the road.
Then my buddy and i were walking down the road dere.
He said.
Let us hide.
The the girls are coming after us.
When the girls come we will jump out.
We will scare ththem you know.
So i said.
You get on that side of the road.
I will get on this other side.
So i hid in this big lilac bush.
Well instead of the two girls coming next there is two more of our buddies coming down the road.
This boy named dick smith said.
He said.
Let us hide and jump out and scare the girls.
He got in the same lilac bush that i was in.
I tried to coordinate my breathing with him ya know.
So he did not know i was there.
He did not have a clue that i was there.
Just as they got there i grabbed him in the ribs and said.
I gotcha!
That is how high he jump.
He hits it off the wrong side of his foot.
It goes through the family picture winda.
He gets up there.
He said.
I wonder if that is one of those neighborhood ruffens.
He looks out there and see that it is his son.
He just said.
Well what am i going to do?
What do you mean the middle the beginning?
His mother says.
I just looked heard a channel report on channel nine.
It is going to pour down rain.
I will give you an umbrella.
Mom come on.
I do not need an umbrella.
So he gets about fifty yards down the road.
All of a sudden it starts raining drizzling there.
Then it start raining hard.
He runs like heck back to the house.
Mother says.
Well now are you going to listen to me?
So the little boy gets the umbrella.
He walks to his friend's house.
He does not get any wetter.
They had up to eleven inches of rain.
The woman thought that she could get across the the bridge.
It swept her car off the road.
She she managed to get out the winda.
She grabbed on to a tree limb there.
She screamed for help.
Somebody saw her.
They called the nineoneone.
The emergency crew came out.
The fireman got out there.
He put his safety belt around her.
He rescued her.
Well there is this fambly.
I think there was three daughters there.
They were all thrilled when they got an invitation that the the prince was going to have this annual ball there.
And he was going to dance with the the most beautiful girl that attended the ball.
She had a beautiful dress picked out that she put on.
When her sister said.
Where do you think you are going?
You are not going there.
You got to scrub the floor you know.
So the mother and the two sisters they go off to the ball.
They leave her there.
Cinderella's crying there.
Her fairy godmother comes and says.
I will take care of it there.
She waves her magic wand there.
Cinderella gets a beautiful white dress.
She gets a coach there drawn by four horses.
They pull up to the castle there.
She gets out of there.
They think that this is really royalty coming there.
The prince spots her immediately.
He starts dancing with her and just has this fabulous time.
The two sisters are just furious that she ended up being there.
So but she had the one promise there.
She hadta be out of the house by midnight there.
So she saw the clock starting to chime the for the twelve strokes there.
So she ran down the stairs.
As she was running down the stairs she left one of her her her glass slippers there.
She got into the coach.
She got home on time.
He is found the woman of his dreams.
He does not know where to look for her.
But he has the slipper there.
So he asked all around.
They they tell him about this house that has these three sisters living together.
So he goes to the house.
He knocks on the door.
He comes in.
He tries to put the slipper on the two older sisters.
Of course it does not fit.
I have got one in the back.
But you know she you are not interested in her.
So i want to see her.
He goes there.
He puts the slipper on.
It fits.
He says.
He marries her.
Alright you want to get your selection of bread.
Either wheat or white bread if you would like.
Whatever you want.
You should use jiff peanut butter.
Bebecause that is made here in lexington.
Then you would spread your jelly on one slice of the bread.
You put the two slices of bread together.
It looks like the dog has chased a kitten up the tree.
Little mary is kind of upset because she wants the kitten out of the tree.
Dad has come out.
So dad's stranded in the tree.
The kitten's stranded in the tree.
Evidently someone has called for help.
The firemen are showing up with a ladder to get dad out of the tree and the kitten out of the tree.
I have had a real tragic experience here in the last year.
I lost my wife after forty years of marriage and.
Never knowing or thinking you know what the woman does around the house.
I never made a bed.
I never really did laundry.
I never ironed.
I never cooked meals.
I have gotten over it with the help of friends and my church and my family.
But you never realize or you do not realize until it happens to you what it is that you hafta go through.
I i thought i knew a whole hell of a lot.
But i did not know half of what i thought i knew.
I really did not.
That you take so much for granted when you have someone with you.
We knew that she only had a certain amount of time.
We spent some real quality time together and but whew!
It hurt.
Well i see this young man who is practicing his soccer kick.
Evidently he is getting pretty good at it.
Because he kicks it far enough that it goes through the living room window of the house.
Dad just happens to be sitting in the easy chair by the window as the ball comes through and knocks the lamp off the table.
Dad picks it up and looks out and kind of wonders.
Is he ever going to be a good soccer player or what?
It is raining outside.
So she gives him an umbrella.
Tells him that he needs to use umbrella to keep from getting wet.
Well he does not adhere to it.
He goes out.
He feels the rain coming down.
He is heading on to school in the rain.
Comes home and he is soaking wet.
The next picture after mom has a talk with him.
You are not going to do this one no.
Rise quick rising water.
The subject is hanging on to a tree limb.
There is an emergency service individual there.
They are having a problem.
Hopefully he accomplished his mission.
I guess he lost his wife.
So he took on another woman.
She had two daughters.
They were married.
The two daughters treated cinderella pretty bad.
They made her do all the housework and and those type things.
She was always left out.
She did not get any the new clothes.
Well in the area they lived the kingdom.
There was a young prince.
He was becoming a young man.
He was looking for his princess.
So they decided they were going to have this ball.
They would invite all the single young girls to this ball.
He would choose someone in from those that come to the ball.
Well of course cinderella did not get to go.
So it just so happened that her fairy godmother appears and said.
Well cinderella if you would like to go fix it so you can go.
So the fairy godmother she dresses cinderella up in a very fine gown and a ball dress and tiara and everything.
She takes a pumpkin and turns it into a carriage.
They go to the palace and go to the ball.
While they are there at the ball of course the prince he is out checking on all the young ladies.
The two stepsisters kind of recognize cinderella.
But all of a sudden the prince happens to notice her.
Notice it that they were trying to off.
So he decides he is going to take cinderella and dance with her.
He does.
I think the gal i would like to spend some more time with.
Well somewhere along the way cinderella has glass slippers.
Her fairy godmother told her.
Now at a certain time in the ball you are going to hafta leave.
So that time comes.
Cinderella is getting ready to leave.
She runs out of the ballroom and down a flight of stairs and to her carriage.
As she does she loses one of her slippers.
She jumps in the carriage.
They take her on back to the house so she will be there when the rest of the family gets back.
They come back.
They are telling the story about the ball and everything.
The fun they have and what went on.
I am sure they mentioned this story about.
Well he picked this girl.
She lost her slipper.
Well the prince decides the next day that he wants to find this girl.
So he sends one of his assistants out.
To the village to look for this girl who wore this glass slipper.
So he goes from house to house.
He happens to come to the house where cinderella lived.
The two stepdaughters why they did not want cinderella to know he was there.
But anyway they try really hard to fit this shoe on their foot.
It just does not happen to fit.
Somehow the assistant there notices the young girl there.
He goes over.
He asks her to try the slipper on and it fits exactly.
So he takes her back to the castle and meets the prince.
"Of course they dance together, fall in love together, and get married and live happily ever after."
You get your bread out.
You get your peanut butter out.
Then you get your jelly out.
You put jelly on the other side.
Then you put the two halves together.
You cut it in half.
You enjoy.
Had her dog and the cat cat went up and got in the tree.
So she called her daddy.
He climbed up in the tree.
His ladder fell down.
He was sitting there.
So they hadta call the fire department.
The two firemen come with their ladder.
I am sure they got up in the tree.
I think it was january the thirteenth when the earthquake hit haiti?
It just so happened that one of my sons went down there the day before.
The day before the earthquake he went down to see if he could help people.
Bebecause he had heard and read how bad off things were people.
There was one fella on the plane.
Then my son wanted to move also.
I do not remember why.
I do not know why he wanted to move.
But he wanted to move.
So he sat next this first fella who moved.
He sat next to hi am.
Well they struck up a conversation.
This other fella happened to be a pastor down in haiti.
Think he had about four churches.
So they became acquainted.
So the pastor said the next day that he wanted to take him around.
Which he did.
On the way back to my son's hotel hotel montana the earthquake struck.
My son had wanted to go right on back to the hotel.
But the pastor wanted to take him off to another spot.
They looked at some churches.
So for that reason my son was not in the hotel when the earthquake hit.
Otherwise he would have been killed.
Or that hotel was flattened as we all know.
So but my son said the truck started shaking around on the road.
So anyway they finally got back into port au prince there.
Saw what had happened.
They tried to help people.
Do what they could do.
But there wadn't much they could do with just their hands.
They had no tools or anything.
Or well everybody knows the story.
How bad it was and how bad it got.
He tried to help people.
He tried encourage ththem.
You know.
Well it got dark.
There were no lights of any kind.
They did what they could do.
That they tried to hang in there you know encourage.
So they prayed with people.
Did they would carry people down the road.
To the medical where people were trying to take care of ththem.
Well in the meantime i had not heard from my son.
But i knew he was there you know.
So i from the time the earthquake hit.
I think that was around five of the clock our time.
Until the next morning at ten thirty eight when my phone rang i did not know if he was dead or alive.
So i went to bed that night with two phones by my head telephones.
We had tried all night somehow to get in touch.
But there was no way you could get in touch with hi am.
So finally the next morning he called me.
He had borrowed somebody is hadta be a satellite phone in order to get out.
Cellphones did not work.
But anyway i heard heard his voice.
The happiest time of my life i guess.
Okay well the little boy's outside playing kickball.
He kicks the ball.
Well it goes right through the window of their house.
I guess that is his daddy.
But anyway it goes through the glass and into the house.
His daddy gets up.
Unless he is run away by that time.
But anyway those things happen.
Probly going off to school he has his backpack on.
Mother says.
You better take the umbrella.
It looks like it is going to rain.
He dudn't want the umbrella.
So he waves goodbye to her.
Off he goes.
Well he gets down the street.
It starts to rain.
I am getting all wet.
Mommy told me to bring the umbrella.
So he turns around and goes back home.
Ma says.
See i told you you should take the umbrella.
He is standing there all wet.
So then he gets the umbrella.
Back off he goes.
Okay now he is got the umbrella.
They are in a rushing creek here.
Looks like a flood came up or something.
Maybe their boat turned over or something.
Anyway they are rushing downstream in the water.
Well he has a lifepreserver on.
I do not know if she does or not.
I cannot see it.
They are hanging on to this tree.
All stressed out here waiting for somebody to rescue ththem i guess.
Okay well cinderella lived at home with her wicked stepmother and the two stepsisters.
They made cinderella do all the work.
She hadta wait on the stepsisters.
Then there was going to be a ball in town.
So she did not have anything to wear.
Of course the stepdaughters were going to be dressed nicely.
She found this dress.
So she put it on.
She said she could go to the ball.
Well she went to the ball.
The fairy godmother tapped her with her wand magic wand.
Got her this beautiful ball gown she had on.
She went to the ball.
The prince saw her coming down the steps.
He fell in love.
They danced.
But the fairy godmother had told her earlier she hadta be home by twelve of the clock.
So they were dancing and having a wonderful time.
She heard the big clock strike midnight.
So she raced back up the steps.
She lost one of her slippers.
But she kept on going.
She got home.
But the prince didn get her name or whatever.
So all he had was this glass slipper.
Do not know who it came from.
So they went looking all over town for somebody who could fit in this glass slipper.
They went to the house where the two little nasty little stepdaughters lived.
It did not fit either one of them.
But cinderella came out.
She said.
Wait i would like to try it on.
They said.
They i do not think the stepmother or stepsisters liked that.
But she did.
It fit perfectly.
So that told him that she was the one who had the prince had fallen in love with.
So he came to meet her.
They went on.
They courted.
And then they got married.
They lived happily ever after.
I would go to the cupboard.
Bebecause everybody knows jiff is the best.
In the refrigerator i have about three or four different kinds of jellies or jams.
So i pick out the one that i am in the mood for that day.
On the counter i lay out two big slices of bread.
Then i take my raspberry jelly.
Is that how you want me to do it?
A little girl is playing.
A little girl is playing out in the yard.
She was riding her tricycle.
The her little kitty cat climbed up a tree on one of the long skinny branches that goes out.
Her daddy came out and climbed up the tree.
But the ladder fell down.
The dog is barking at the man.
The dad is sitting in a tree where he cannot get down.
So the fire department comes along with another ladder.
They are going to rescue both daddy and the kitty.
I think the saddest time in my life was when my husband got sick.
He had cancer.
He always did inside work.
Most of his work entailed meetings and telephones.
So whenever he was home free we spent a lot of time in the yard and and garden and all.
He liked to do yard work.
But the cancer robbed him of of the ability to work any length of time outside.
So he sat outside a lot.
We had a dog who was very very close to him.
When when my husband passed away the dog waited for hi am.
Sat in the driveway and waited for him to come home from work.
And could not understand why he did not come home.
A young boy is playing soccer out in the yard.
He gives the soccer ball a big kick.
It flies through a picture window.
Surprises the man sitting in the chair.
He is looking out the the big hole in the window.
Trying to figure out what happened.
He has the soccer ball in his hand.
Well it looks like it is going to be a rainy day.
So mama wants her son to take the umbrella to school with him.
He is got on his backpack.
He is smiling.
He says.
He he says.
I do not think i am going to need it.
I think i am going to be alright.
So he goes out.
Of course then it starts raining really really hard.
So by the time he gets back home he is so wet.
So he changes into some dry clothes.
Now we are skipping one.
I think this is a young adult who has somehow fallen into flood waters.
Worried about how she is going to get back to dry land.
When a rescuer comes.
He is wearing a a lifevest.
He straps the a a strap across her.
Cinderella's dad got remarried.
So she acquired not only a stepmother but two stepsisters who were kind of ugly.
So cinderella did spent a lot of time with the animals outside.
Doing things for her stepsisters who seem to spend a lot of time on their looks.
One day they all had an invitation from the prince to go to a ball at the castle.
So of course cinderella was not going to be allowed to go if she did not have the clothes to do it.
But the ugly stepsisters were dressed up.
They all left for the ball.
But she accepted it.
Her fairy godmother brought out her magic wand and tapped different things.
Pumpkin turned into a coach.
And the mice turned into to i do not know carriage men.
I do not know what they are called.
Cinderella had a beautiful gown.
Then they all went to the ball.
The only stipulation was that at midnight she would hafta return to her cinderella state.
So she went to the ball.
The prince and cinderella danced.
He was very taken with her.
She looked up at the clock.
The clock was getting ready to strike midnight.
So she ran down the stairs.
Returned to her house where where she was again clad in her old clothes.
The the carriage and the carriage men returned to their mice an pumpkin status.
When her stepmama and stepsisters came home they were raving about the ball that they had gone to.
Cinderella did not say that she had gone.
So she went back to to her normal life.
In the meantime the prince was trying to find cinderella.
She had disappeared so rapidly.
He wanted to be able to see her again.
So he sent out on a search for her with his manservants.
But they came to their home.
The ugly stepsisters of course thought that they would fit into the the glass slippers.
Whoever did was going to of course be part of the prince's life.
So they could not fit into it.
He went out.
He stopped to to try it on cinderella.
So cinderella and the prince were married.
It looks very probably that the dog chased the cat up the tree.
The little girl probably went off got her dad or her neighbor.
Who brought his ladder over and laid it up on the tree.
In the interim the ladder got out from under him.
The cat seems comfortable.
Dad or the neighbor looks forlorn.
The fire department has just gotten gotten there.
I do not eat ththem very often.
But the kids useta eat ththem.
My wife still enjoys one every now and then.
So basically i ensure i have some jif smooth peanut butter always available.
Then the jelly does not really matter.
Especially when i am fixing it.
So i take the peanut butter out of the cabinet.
My wife likes it.
I take two big slices of that out.
Bebecause that way she knows she is got peanut butter on this peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I tend to like to cut it in half so she does not hafta.
You probably do it all the time.
But i cut it in half.
That is how i make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well i i would say probably the the most disappointing day of my life was the day that the us pulled out of vietnam.
The helicopters left the rooftop embassy there in saigon.
There was a lot of of this country's fortune that was you know spent over there and left over there.
That was probably the most disappointing and downer day that i have ever gone through.
You know you see parents age and pass on.
But to see that a poorly conceived effort over there that was then abandoned that was gutwrenching for me.
I i hated that day.
It is the young man is out kicking what appears to be a soccer ball.
He must have a good strong leg because he kicked it through the picture window.
It appears to be of a a gentleman's house.
That jumps up.
Looks out to where it has come from.
You have really no feel for how he is going to respond to that.
But there is got to be some kind of reckoning coming i would guess one way or the other.
Well mom's trying to talk junior into taking an umbrella out.
He is he knows more than mom.
So he takes off without the umbrella.
Gets part way on his way i assume to school.
Believe it or not it starts to rain.
Looks like he makes a one eighty.
He is soaking wet.
But believe it or not he thought he would be better off going to school using the umbrella.
What is going on here is obviously there is been some very heavy rains or a burst dam or something that has caused a lot of high water in an area.
During that high water episode it appears that a young lady has gotten herself into a world of trouble.
Has been caught in a stream or at least some rapidly flowing water.
Evidently someone saw her and called in the rescue unit.
It appears that they are in the process of trying to get the young lady out of her predicament.
Is in the process of attempting to save the young lady.
If my memory serves me correctly she was a young lady that was not in the best of life situations.
I do not know whether indentured to this family or how she got into it.
But she had some sisters or halfsisters or something like that.
I do not remember the exact relationship.
But there were a couple of other sisters there.
Then there is going to be a a big shindig.
I do not know what drove the shindig.
The two girls her sisters got all outfitted and and dressed up and everything and were going to be allowed to go.
Poor cinderella's you know stuck at home with the aunt and doing the chores.
Until when that nice oldd fairy godmother comes along.
She ends up dressed to beat all.
There was of course one stipulation.
She hadta be out of there by midnight or something like that.
Interim she hadta run off for some reason or other.
She had danced with the prince.
So she ends up having to flee the place.
He loses track of her.
Except i believe she had thrown a shoe if you would.
And as it evolves he cast about his domain.
Goes around trying to find the young lady that the tiny slipper fits.
Lo and behold it turns out to be cinderella.
I guess she had her man.
The first thing i would do would be to go to the pantry and make sure i have peanut butter.
But i like the chunky style because i eat a lot of peanuts.
I eat a lot of almonds.
I eat them for the nutritional value.
So i do eat considerable peanut butter.
From a sandwich standpoint it is a little bit different for me to even think of eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but i usually eat most of my peanut butter on saltine crackers.
I am not just eating a snack.
I will then go and fin some bread.
Sometimes i keep my bread in the refrigerator so it does not mold so quick.
If i had done that i will usually toast the bread.
Because i do not like it to be cold when i eat it.
Otherwise i may have taken it off the counter.
For my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches i would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an italian or french bread.
Because that would give me the extra flavor of the crust.
So once i have located my bread.
I now have my peanut butter.
I would go to my drawer where i keep my utensils and bring out a butter style knife.
Is that when i make i usually do straight peanut butter sandwiches.
Where i would put plenty of peanut butter well on one side of but on both slices of bread.
In this case i hafta go and alter my plan.
Have them put the peanut butter only on the one piece of bread.
I would use the jelly on the other.
Because i just like strawberry.
So after i got that out of the refrigerator i would do the same with that.
Well mary came in and found her dad.
Was crying and totally upset because her favorite kitten had climbed up the backyard tree.
Well dad said to her that.
I will just come out.
I will get a ladder.
We can just get up there in no time.
But in the meantime the poor old dog is barking up the tree.
That does not make anything go any easier.
It just disturbs probably everybody.
In fact it what had actually happened with the dog barking up the tree and the father had the ladder up against the tree.
It it messed him up so much that the ladder fell down.
But he has nice company because right to his right he has the kitten.
Instead of flowers on the tree i have a cat in it.
I have poor dad sitting up on a limb.
But i have a nice wonderful bird singing over to the other side.
But she knows that this cannot last for too long.
Dad hasta get out of the tree to go to work.
So she calls the fire department.
Fortunately they are trained a lot better on having ladder rescues.
So they quickly get there with their firetruck.
Come running over to the tree in order to rescue everyone.
Well i guess when i caught my largest personal muskie.
You know now being a muskie fishing guide.
Everybody asks you.
Well what is the biggest fish you have caught?
I can remember fishing for this fish.
But i had sighted this fish a number of times in his cove.
We we do a lot of our fishing around the moon times.
Whether it be a full moon and a new moon.
Also on the time that the moon rises and sets.
Sometimes they set in conjunction with the sunrise and sunset.
So that even gives you more impetus to be on the water at that time.
Is it raining?
When a front is coming through that is almost a trump card for catching big fish.
So on this particular day i knew a front was coming in.
Which was going to be a special time as far as the moon went.
I was fishing in the area of this fish.
Thinking that maybe the barometric pressure would change.
It would entice this fish to hit my lure.
Sure enough it did.
At that time i did not have a what i would call a good fishing boat.
I had one of the old style aluminum fishing jon boats.
That was back before i started to guide.
But i had my son with me.
I hooked into this fish.
I knew it was a big fish.
It was so strong it was actually moving the boat.
I know that the boat was a jon boat.
But we actually were moved across the water with this.
Eventually i managed to get the fish netted.
Bebecause we we like to catch them again and let somebody else enjoy them.
It it is you know a memorable things of my life to have that.
Now i have had bigger fish in my boat.
I have had fish over fifty inches in my boat.
But i did not personally catch them.
"But like all things , murphy caught up with bobby."
As he did one of his kicks it ended up going through the front window of his house.
Poor oldd dad's sitting on the chair in the living room.
Gets quite startled as the soccer ball not only comes through the window but also knocks the lamp off of the table.
He has not much else to do but to pick up the soccer ball.
See what was going on.
He sees his son out there.
Unfortunately that's the one who had kicked the ball.
Well it is another day at getting ready for school.
You know jimmy's got his backpack on getting ready to go to school.
Mom knows it is going to rain that day.
So he offers to have hi am take the umbrella with hi am.
But you know boys just do not like to carry umbrellas.
It is one of them sissy things we all hear about.
So he declines to take it.
He gets out.
He hasta start walking in the raindrops.
He gets to wherever he thought he was going but hasta come back because now he is all soaking wet.
His hair's all soaking wet.
So he returns back to his house.
His mother looks at him with the good old look.
Well you know you did not hafta be this way.
I you know i tried to offer you the umbrella.
So now after being soaked he figures.
Well i better take that umbrella to get the rest of my trip done.
He takes it.
The rains and the creeks came up real rapidly.
As suzy was returning from school she tried to go across the waterway.
Fortunately as she was being dragged down in the river she was able to hook on to a tree.
One of the fire department rescuers actually swam out with his life saving equipment on him.
He took another lifejacket with him.
Besides the one he was wearing.
Put it on suzy so that eventually he would end up getting her back to shore.
Cinderella lived in a house with her two sisters and her evil grandmother.
That did not matter if she was out tending the animals out in the baright now or feeding the dog or slopping the hogs.
Her two older sisters they just had the run of the house.
They just got to go to all the parties and play around the way they wanted to do.
No matter what cinderella said to her evil grandmother the grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters.
Well every year they have this large dance in town.
So they had this big party.
Everybody gets dressed up.
There is all kind of food and dancing and so forth.
I mean she is just always shunned.
Because she is just the dog sort of as far as the evil grandmother knows.
So the two sisters come along.
They get all dressed up.
Well they are having such a wonderful time.
But all of a sudden a fairy godmother appears to her and says.
Cinderella why are you sitting at home?
Well i do not have a dress.
I have no preparations you know.
My grandmother hates me.
My sisters hate me.
I am never allowed to go anywhere.
So the fairy godmother says.
Well we are going to fix that today.
I am going to get you a new gown.
In fact i am going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball.
So he she helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown.
I think her her feet were made out of like glass slippers.
So she gets transported to the dance.
In fact you know with the king and the queen and the prince being there.
The date seems to go by so quickly.
But all of a sudden cinderella hears the clock ringing.
The bells start chiming.
She remembers that her fairy godmother said that.
Boy you really needta be back home here before midnight.
Or else you are going to turn back into the cinderella person.
All of this stuff is going to be washed away.
Everybody will know that it is just like a ploy.
So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from.
But she does manage to get home.
Her fairy godmother collects up all of her garb and everything.
Everything's swell as far as the the fairy godmother's concerned.
Cinderella feels.
Well you know i really feel bad that i lost my shoe.
But you know i i did not have time to go back and get it.
So when the two other sisters get back they tell how wonderful party was too.
An they were a little upset that this stranger happened to show up and really got all the attention of the prince.
You know it was really them that were really more beautiful than anybody else.
They do not quite understand why the prince would have thought this stranger was any good.
So they went back into doing their regular stuff at home.
He had her shoe.
He deccided that he was going to go door to door.
Find if he could find this person.
So he is going through to all these neighborhoods.
He comes to cinderella's house.
Of course the evil grandmother knows for sure it is going to be one of the older daughters.
That it hadta be one of their slippers.
Because she had this motive that she would love to get the prince to marry one of her daughters.
So the prince comes in and tries the slipper on evil daughter number one.
It do not fit.
He goes to evil daughter number two.
It do not fit.
Out of nowhere here comes cinderella in from the barn looking like a hag.
Because that is the way they make her dress.
The prince says.
The evil grandmother says.
Well you know you can see what she looks like.
You know she is no beauty.
He says.
He says.
I i just feel compeled that i hafta at least try the slipper on her foot.
So he talks cinderella into sitting down.
He tries the slipper on.
It fits.
He ends up realizing that this was the person.
He does not quite understand how she could be this hag looking.
But he had love at first sight.
He now knows that with the slipper fitting that it had to be her.
So he ends up getting together with ththem.
He ends up taking cinderella with him.
He now gets her all dressed up and looking the beauty that she is.
They just happen to live happily ever after.
There was a family that had a dog and a cat.
The dog was chasing the cat.
It climbed up a tree.
An so the little girl was wanting it down so badly.
But she could not reach it.
So the father came home.
He climbed up in the tree.
He got stuck.
He could not get down either.
He thought he could get the cat but he could not.
So someone called the fire department.
The fire department came with a ladder to help out and to get the kitty down.
First you would get your bread out.
I usually spread a paper towel and put the bread on it.
Then i get my peanut butter.
Then i get the jelly.
Then i put the other top on.
Then i get a knife and slice it so it is easier to eat.
Well probably the most traumatic thing that happened to me was my father passed away when i was fourteen.
I had a really difficult time letting go of him.
I would dream dreams of him at night.
This went on for probably two months.
Finally i had one dream.
I felt like it was from god.
I dreamed that i was walking across a a big pasture of green grass.
There was a tree in the distance.
There was a table underneath it with a lot of people around it.
I walked over to it.
They could not see me.
But i could see them.
I saw my dad sitting there.
He was smiling and laughing and eating.
I felt like god had showed me that he was okay.
There was a little boy.
He was kicking it around.
Accidentally it went through the picture window.
His dad was sitting inside.
An here came the ball.
His dad gets up.
The little boy was getting ready to go to school.
His mother said.
It is going to rain today.
You needta take this umbrella.
He said.
No i do not need that umbrella.
So she is still holding the umbrella in her hand.
He is waving goodbye.
He does not go very far and it starts pouring rain.
He is got his hands over his head trying to keep dry.
He is walking through puddles.
She says.
I told you so.
So then he takes the umbrella.
I have had that happen.
One day there was a flash flood in this town.
People were not expecting it.
But it came really fast.
An there was a a young girl that got caught in the flood.
She was hanging on to a tree.
So one of the rescue men swam over and got to the tree.
He is holding on trying to save her.
Cinderella was a little girl that had lost her mother.
She lived with her father.
Her father remarried.
So she had a stepmother and two stepsisters.
She thought everything was going to be okay.
But it wasn't long until she found out that they only wanted her to be their servant.
They treated her very mean.
One day they got a notice from the king that they were having a ball.
Cinderella thought.
Oh i would love to go.
But they would not let her go.
The stepsisters dressed up in their finest.
They went to the ball.
Well cinderella's fairy godmother showed up.
Told her she was going to get to go.
Cinderella said.
Oh but i have nothing to wear.
So the fairy godmother waved her wand.
She had a beautiful dress on and glass slippers.
She says.
I have no way to get there.
The fairy godmother showed her outside that there was a big pumpkin as a carriage.
There was mice that were the footmen and the drivers.
She said.
So cinderella went to the ball.
She met the prince.
An they just loved each other from the moment they met.
Well the clock started to strike twelve.
Cinderella remembered what her fairy godmother told her.
So she left the ball running.
She glost one of her glass slippers on the steps.
An so the prince started looking for her.
He could not find her.
But he found a glass slipper.
So he said.
I will go fin whoever this fits.
So naturally the stepsisters decided.
Oh this glass slipper's got to fit one of us.
Well they tried it.
Their feet would not fit in it.
Bebecause cinderella had a dainty little foot.
So finally cinderella got to try on the glass slipper.
So he knew that that she was the one.
Fluffy the cat chased the bird up the tree.
Then fluffy could not come down.
So daddy got a ladder and went up the tree to get the cat.
The dog came along.
Daddy called his little girl out.
She did.
The fire company came.
Rescued daddy and the cat.
The bird stayed where it was.
Well first you take two pieces of bread.
You can toast ththem if you want.
Then you lay them on the counter.
You get out your jar of peanut butter.
You put peanut butter on the left hand slice.
You get out your jar of jelly.
You put the jelly on the right hand slice.
Then you take your right hand slice.
You have a sandwich.
Yes when i was serving in the embassy in moscow.
The russians had just expelled aleksandr solzhenitsyn.
Who you may know is a very famous russian writer.
It seemed to me the wrong thing to do just when the soviets had expelled their most prominent writer.
Basically they had stripped him of his citizenship.
Told him he could never come back.
It seemed to me we should remark that in some way.
The embassy disagreed.
So i sent the message to washington.
Washington did not agree with me.
The poet came.
The visit went off well enough.
That all worked well.
But i still felt very badly that the united states government had not taken any recognition whatsoever of the soviets expelling one of their most prominent writers simply because they did not like what he wrote.
He gives the ball a good hard kick.
Bang it goes right through mister baker's window.
Who is sitting in his easy chair in the living room watching t v.
Mister baker picks up the ball.
Then he remembers that he also played soccer as a boy.
That he broke someone is window.
He decides that he will just throw the ball back outside.
Let things go.
The weather report says rain.
So mom gives him the umbrella.
But johnny does not want the umbrella.
He says that.
It is not going to rain.
But as soon as he is out on the street it does rain.
It rains very hard.
He gets wet.
So he runs back home.
An he admits to his mother that he was wrong.
That really he really does need that umbrella.
Which she then gives him.
Then he goes off to school dry.
Well a young lady has fallen in the kentucky river which is swollen because of the spring rains.
She grabs ahold of a branch.
When her friends who are still on the riverbank call the rescue squad.
The rescue squad comes.
With a belt or a sling of some sort or another gets it around the girl and pulls her to safety.
It may have been that she goes to this family under false pretenses because she winds up really as a servant to the mother and these two girls.
Both of whom are spoiled and rather mean to cinderella.
The king announces that there is going to be a ball.
I guess it is a ball the prince is expected to choose a woman to be his wife.
The two girls in the family of course get themselves all dressed up with very high expectations that one of them might be chosen.
As they go off to the ball the fairy godmother comes and dresses cinderella up.
Tells her she can go to the ball too.
As a matter of fact gets a pumpkin and mice as i recall.
Which are turned into a horse and carriage.
Cinderella goes off to the ball.
Of course cinderella turns out to be the belle of the ball.
The prince falls madly in love with her.
Cinderella though cannot stay after midnight because the fairy godmother has told her horse and the wagon will turn back into mice and a pumpkin at midnight.
So she hasta run to get in the carriage to go back back home before the stroke of midnight.
She loses one of her slippers.
The prince who is now madly in love with her sets out to find who whose foot fits that slipper.
Both of the evil sisters try their feet but they do not fit.
She and the prince are married.
All of the sudden she looks up and sees her favorite kitty cat sitting on a limb in the tree.
Well she gets really upset.
She says.
Daddy you got to do something about that.
So daddy climbs the tree.
He gets up there and he gets stuck.
Now we have got daddy and the cat up the tree.
The dog comes along.
Starts barking.
So they call the fire department.
They are going to get the cat out of the tree.
Then they will get dad out of the tree.
Oh he does not eat jelly.
My father had a heart attack and died two days later.
So our whole family structure changed dramatically.
My mother hadta go to work.
We got this ugly german maid came and and lived with us.
She did not like me much which was fine.
I did not like her either.
He kicks the soccer ball.
The window just jumps in his way.
That is the story i always get from my husband and my daughter.
Unfortunately soccer ball goes through window into dad's lap.
Well johnny's going off to school.
Take your umbrella because it is going to rain.
He is saying.
Well i will not need it but okay.
So he gets outside.
Lo and behold it is raining.
I did need the umbrella.
So he turns around and goes back in the house.
I did need the umbrella.
She is going.
So he changes clothes.
Do you needta say something else?
It rained.
By the time they woke up in the morning.
Then this has actually happened is what i am thinking.
By the time they woke up in the morning the creek what they were camping beside was flooded over its banks.
By the time everybody realized it they were in the water.
A fire rescue person suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
She is hanging onto a tree.
A fire rescue person appears out of nowhere.
He is going to get her out of there hopefully.
It starts once upon a time.
It is the story of a widowed father and a very young daughter.
Who decides that his daughter needs a mother.
So he marries the ugly stepmother.
With two half grown daughters.
After a few years the the father dies.
So poor cinderella is left at the tender mercy of of mother stepmother and the two sisters.
She is forced to work as a servant in her own home.
She lives in the attic.
She they yell at her.
The only friends that she has in the walt disney version of cinderella are the mice and the birds and the little wild things.
So as she gets to be a young lady the king and queen decide it is time for their son to get married.
So they are going to have a big ball to introduce him to all of the eligible ladies of of the kingdom.
So everyone is invited.
Cinderella is all excited because she assumes that she will get to go too.
When it comes time for the ball she has no dress to wear.
So the furry friends help her make a dress.
She hurries up and gets the sisters together.
They go.
You cannot have ththem.
They tear the dress off of her.
So she goes crying into the garden as the two ugly step sisters go off to the ball in the carriage.
The fairy godmother comes.
Oh sweetie you are destined to go to the ball.
So we will fix you up.
But you must leave before the stroke of midnight.
So she taps her wand.
There is a beautiful dress.
The pumpkin becomes a carriage.
The mice become footmen.
The mice become the the horses.
The dog becomes the footmen.
They go off to the ball.
She dances with the princess prince until the stroke of midnight.
When the clock starts to ring she remembers she was sposta leave.
She says.
Oh i must go i must go.
She goes tearing down the steps.
When they come look for her she produces the shoe.
It looks like a photo of firemen off to the right running with their ladder.
At the base of the tree is a dog barking at someone up in the top of the tree.
The person's sitting on a limb.
The the individual's trying to get the cat down.
There is a little girl down at the bottom of the tree where the cat is.
She is screaming at the cat.
It looks like the firemen are actually coming to help retrieve the cat.
The dog will be probably walk away after all this is over.
You have a jar of peanut butter.
I would spread the jelly on one side of the bread.
I would spread the peanut butter on the other side of the bread.
Then i would put two pieces together.
Something that really could have affected my life completely was an incident at sea.
I was an officer aboard a guided missile frigate off the coast of north vietnam working with another navy ship.
You are working plenty of close quarters during a clear day.
We are probably running maybe twenty twenty five knots.
The navy have this expression steady bearing decreasing range which is basically a collision.
Steady bearing at sea and decreasing range what happens is a collision.
Well i call down to the captain.
I told him the range was ten thousand yards steady bearing.
He said he would be up in just a second.
I called him.
I said.
It is getting close.
The ship on the starboard pan always has the right away at sea.
I would do something.
At about two thousand yards i threw the rudder right full.
I threw the rudder right full at all head full.
I turned everything over downstairs.
In the mess halls we were sitting like this going to the right.
As he comes on the bridge he is fanatic.
He is he comes on the bridge.
He sees the other ship's fantail about three hundred yards off my left passing in front of us.
I am going the right.
The ship's going like that.
If i would waited for him to come up we would have cut the other ship completely in two.
It would have destroyed his career.
It would have destroyed my career.
But i had myself covered.
Because we have something called the quarter master log.
The quarter master log everything you do on the bridge is an answer way.
You log it in.
Quarter master log it kept it notified.
Eight thousand yards decreasing.
So he ran me off the bridge.
He wouldn let me back up there for three days.
Finally he calls me back up.
He says.
You know i think you are going to make a fine naval officer.
I am going to recommend you for destroyer school in newport rhode island.
I think what he did was check the log.
He lives here in lexington.
He is a retired admiral.
But i learned you know do not be afraid to make a decision.
When you really hafta make one fast or you are going to kill somebody.
Oh i see.
He kicks it.
It heads for a window.
It goes through the window.
Looks like he might be reading a paper or something.
It comes through the glass.
It breaks the glass.
The father's standing there looking out.
I assume it is his father looking out the window holding the ball in his hand.
Child's going to school.
The mother has an umbrella.
But the child refuses.
So the child goes outside.
On the way to school it starts raining.
It is still raining.
He is trying to get out of it.
So he shows back up at the house.
He completely soaked.
His mother gives him the umbrella.
He leaves.
There is a raging flood.
There is a lady in the picture.
Looks like she is been caught in the storm.
But she has a rescuer.
He is got a lifejacket on.
He is probably got a cable attached to him.
It looks like he is got a strap around her.
He is got ahold of her.
He is getting ready to take her out of the water safely.
She scrubs floors.
Basically the other three sisters seem like they have been given the right to not do anything.
Well one of the sisters gets a invitation to the ball.
So they are all invited to go.
Cinderella cannot go.
For some reason they do not tell her.
Or they did not let her go.
Anyways she is heartbroken.
So she wants to go to the ball.
But she has nothing to wear.
So in some way she ends up crying.
Her fairy godmother comes out of nowhere.
Has her fitted with a beautiful gown.
She has no way of getting to the ball.
But the the mean sisters thought she was going to stay home.
Transportation actually is a pumpkin that is turned into a carriage.
So she goes to the ball.
This prince that was there is so well taken by her beauty that he asked her to dance.
At midnight she is supposed to leave.
Or the coach turns back into a pumpkin.
All the drivers turn back into mice.
Her coachmen turn back into mice.
So she looks up.
So she runs back out.
She gets in the coach.
She goes home.
In the process of leaving she drops a slipper.
The prince puts out a edict to the land.
He wants find out who the girl was wearing this magic slipper.
He says whoever he can find that the slipper fits he will make her his wife.
All the women in the land come to be fitted with the slipper.
The three ugly sisters try.
Lo and behold cinderella's probably the last one to try the slipper on.
It fits.
Then i would get the grape jelly out.
Looks like a cat has got stranded in a tree.
The father had climbed the tree.
The dog is looking up the tree.
There is a ladder there by the little girl.
Evidently they didn use that.
Then there is a a bird chirping in the tree.
Here comes the firemen to with a ladder to help get the cat out of the tree.
I had played basketball in high school.
Well i also had gone out for the football.
I just played one year of football in high school.
But anywow did not stay long football field.
But i did go out for basketball.
An i made the the freshman team.
At that time they had a freshman team at kentucky.
I made the team.
It was very something that i will never forget being around adolph lastname and harry lastname.
We would scrimmage against the varsity an what have you.
It was just something that i will never forget.
The a young man is kicking a soccer ball looks like.
He kicks it through his somebody is window.
The soccer ball comes through the window.
A man is sitting in a chair.
The he picks up the soccer ball.
Boy i guess.
Look like his mother wants him take a umbrella.
He he he he doesn't want to do it.
Then he has started.
It is raining.
An he comes back in.
His mother's looking at him with her hand on her hips.
An then finally he takes the umbrella.
This young lady kind of gets washed away.
She finds a a branch in the water that she is holding on to.
It looks like a fireman coming to rescue her.
He is having a little struggle there.
He is getting ready to rescue her.
Cinderella had a mean mother an two mean sisters.
She was going through a a trunk house.
The angel appeared.
She got all dressed up in silver slippers.
An the prince fell in love with her.
They danced and were having a great time.
It clock turn at twelve her spell would be over.
She would you know hafta return to her sad life.
So she left in haste.
In doing so she left one of her slippers.
So the prince was trying to find her.
So he went through all the neighborhood trying to have the girls to try on the the slipper.
An she he found cinderella.
It fit her.
They got married.
Well i first go to the bread drawer.
On a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i like to add butter.
So i would put butter first on one slice of the bread.
Then the jelly which i had gotten out of the refrigerator.
A cat has crawled up and gotten out on a branch on a tree.
Little girl has found the cat cannot get it.
So dad has come out.
He is gotten a ladder.
But the ladder has fallen down.
The dog has come.
He is barking at the father who is in the tree.
The little girl is crying bebecause her cat is on a branch.
Somebody has called the fire department as they have come out with another ladder to get the cat down.
I grew up in a town about two thousand people in illinois.
My wife and i were looking for our our first home in mundelein illinois.
So we were living in her town where i was teaching at the time.
So we went into mundelein to look for a home.
We found a home.
Twenty thousand five hundred dollars i remember.
So i put down five hundred dollars came back to her house.
When we walked in the kitchen.
I could tell something was wrong bebecause her mom and dad were just very quiet kind of looking down.
The dad looked up and said.
Dave i have some bad news for you.
Your father's been killed n accident.
It just i said.
He said.
This was when back when doctors made house calls in the country.
He went out and gave this ninety year old woman a shot.
As he was coming back he stopped at a four way rural stop.
Then he started out.
He got hit by a pick up truck full of tires because vandals had taken those two stop signs down over that weekend.
He was killed instantly.
So what had been a happy day turned out to be the saddest day of my life.
Okay we have a young man outside on the lawn kicking a soccer ball.
As he does so he kicks the soccer ball through the window possibly of his own home.
The man gets up looks out the window.
He either does or does not see the little boy.
He is getting ready to go to school probably.
It is raining outside.
So here you take the umbrella.
But the son says.
No i do not want to take an umbrella.
Boys do not use umbrellas.
So he says goodbye to his mother who is looking at him very sternly still wanting him to take the umbrella.
He starts walking to school.
It begins to rain.
Rains coming down harder and harder now.
He is holding his hand over his head.
He goes back to his house soaking wet.
His mother glares down at him with the “i told you so” look.
Now son has succumbed.
I remember a little bit about it yes.
They look down upon cinderella.
Then they are invited to this gala in the castle where there is a young man who is a prince who is looking for a wife.
So cinderella helps the the daughters get dressed.
But they both expect that they could be the one to marry the prince.
What i forget is how the slipper comes in and how cinderella gets gala.
But anyway she ends up going to the party.
She has these beautiful shoes on.
I do not know how she got there somehow.
But anyways she goes to the party.
The prince sees her.
She knows that she cannot be with the prince.
So she runs away but loses one of her shoes.
So now the prince is looking for someone who is wearing that shoe.
But he finally found finds cinderella.
She fits the shoe.
So they live happily ever after.
This story begins with a kitty cat up a tree.
So evidently she has called her father to come to help get the cat down.
But in order to get the cat and the father down it looks like the fire department has sent their equipment out to try to retrieve both the cat and the man.
So the end of the story will probably take place when they get that ladder set up and get the cat down.
Well first thing you got to have have some some bread.
So i get get my bread.
I simply take a knife and a peanut butter jar.
I take the top off the peanut butter jar.
I insert the knife into the peanut butter and extract it.
Then once it is covered the bread sufficiently i put the other piece of bread on top.
I have got a sandwich.
Then i eat it.
Our mailbox was situated on the highway a hundred and fifty seven.
Which was about a mile and a half from where we lived back off the road.
I stopped to get the mail on my way home.
Retrieved from the box a nice little note that said.
Greetings your friends and neighbors have selected you.
So i was notified immediately on day the day of my graduation from college that i was eligible for the draft for the korean war.
So in a few weeks we went to doctor norvell for a pre preexamination because i had had some yellow jaundice.
They said that they needed to check me out before i go in for an army.
So i went in to doctor norvell.
He said.
You know.
I could say that you were unfit for military service if you want me to.
I said.
No i i do not want to be unfit.
I i i want to serve my opportunity for if it is mine.
So we were then sent to fort knox for up to louisville to have a preentry exam.
A few days later they said.
Then october the thirteenth of nineteen fifty we joined the a bus in front of the old new castle hotel.
At fort knox we we became soldiers.
And from there we played basketball and baseball.
Before we could do those kind of things we hadta go through basic training.
We got through basic training.
They sent mostly most of our guys to korea.
But fortunately they kept myself and my best buddy as cadre for the one sixty ninth infantry regimen.
Ultimately we wound up going to europe.
Got a call from a one officer mazarella who said he wanted me to join the regimental basketball team.
So colonel broterson said.
No you cannot go.
When he walked in the door i told him that one officer mazera mazarell wanted to talk to him.
He handed handed wazinski the phone.
He talked to mazarella for a short moment.
He turned around to our cclonel and said.
Have him report to vantos this afternoon.
Then i spent the rest of the time playing basketball and baseball.
Well johnny's getting ready to go to school.
Mother wants him to take his umbrella because it looks like it might rain outside.
But little johnny says.
Ah it is not going to rain.
Mom you you you keep that umbrella.
I do not want it.
It is it is not going to rain today.
As he progresses and starts walking toward school it starts to rain.
It rains harder than he had anticipated.
So he turns around.
He goes running back home to get his umbrella.
But he is going to get soaking wet before he gets there.
When he walks in his mother is most upset.
She said.
If you'da taken your umbrella when you started you would not be all wet now.
But anyway the little guy gets his umbrella.
He is just having a great time kicking that soccer ball.
We useta play kick the can because we did not have a soccer ball.
So we would kick the can to school.
But he is such a strong legged young man he wails away and kicks that thing.
It leaves the pathway he is traveling.
The neighbor is sitting in his chair.
He is most surprised to find a volleyball blasting through his window and landing in his lap.
He is immediately angry with the young man for having kicked the ball through his window.
So in his way of retaliating he is going to hold that ball.
Make that young man come and apologize for kicking a ball through his window.
But one of the sisters she kind of treats adopted or out of the family type of situation.
So the two two girls are basically wined and dined and dressed and treated in the very best manner.
There comes a big dance that they are they are going to attend.
The two girls that are favored by their mother have all the finest of clothes and get everything ready.
The other girl she is cleaning.
She is she cannot go plan to go to the dance.
But along come somebody with a magic pumpkin idea that she could go to the the dance in the magic pumpkin.
So she dresses and goes dance.
She outshines the two older sisters her two more favored sisters.
And she is having a great time and a great evening.
But they had told her that she hadta leave at a certain time or the pumpkin returned from a beautiful carriage to a pumpkin.
So she was realizing that she hadta hurry to get back home.
She dance.
Hurry to leave the dance she lost one of her slippers.
The prince wanted to know the person who had it.
So he ran a contest to see which girl feet foot would fit the slipper that got lost.
It was the the one that was down in the area cleaning up the floors and one thing another.
But she was really chosen by her foot fitting the slipper that was at the dance that that the prince thought was such a good deal.
Well i have never made one.
But i would think that you would get a piece of bread out.
Then you would spread peanut butter on top of the bread.
Then you would get a jar of jelly.
Then you would need another piece of bread to make a sandwich.
Well the little girl had a cat.
The cat got up in the tree.
So the little girl's father decided he would climb up the tree and get the cat.
But when he got up there he could not reach her.
Somebody called the fire firemen.
They came with a ladder.
Anything i can do to help people i just love to do it.
That is what god put me on his earth for is was is to help people.
I get so much joy out of helping others.
He is kicking his it looks like a basketball.
But he kicks it.
It went through the neighbor's window.
Inside the house the man of the house was sitting watching t v.
When all of a sudden here is a ball coming at him.
He catches it.
He goes over to the window.
He is not very happy that the little boy has accidentally kicked in his front window.
This little boy was going to school one day.
His mother wanted him to take the umbrella.
But he did not want to take the umbrella.
No mother i do not want to take the umbrella.
He started walking to school.
All of a sudden it started raining.
He decided to run back home to the tell the his mother that he would take the umbrella so he would not get any wetter than he already was.
Once in there was a a prince who was looking for a a princess.
He had met her.
But he she hadta leave in a hurry.
She dropped one of her slippers.
He had fallen in love with her.
He was had the slipper.
He took the slipper with him.
Whoever foot would go in the slipper was his princess.
He was going to marry her.
First i need to decide two pieces of bread.
Then i put on the the peanut butter.
Was a one piece of bread i would fold it probably.
Apparently the the cat had gone up a tree and out on a limb.
The little girl with her tricycle was was crying.
And the father had had gone up the tree.
But the ladder fell down.
The the firemen had been called in.
They were bringing a ladder over to get the cat down.
And and they will they will come down.
But i do not think the father.
Well in nineteen forty one i joined the navy just after i got out of high school.
And after boot camp they sent me to a a navy communications school in los angeles.
I was there japanese bombed pearl harbor.
And i i turned eighteen a couple days out.
But i found that i was on the armed guard service.
They the navy puts a few people on there to man the guns.
Then they go to all kinds of strange ports.
They they often travel in in convoys.
So they needed a trained signalman on it.
That is why i went to the communication school.
Then the second ship i was on i was in new orleans having gone through the canal panama canal.
In the old days they they you hadta go to a movie.
They would have the news.
You know at before the television.
There was this ship.
They had built it on labor day in nineteen forty two.
And i saw it movie tone you know.
And and later i was assigned to that ship.
We went to auckland new zealand twenty one days.
Then we went up a length of a hundred miles up to new castle.
We went to new caledonia.
Then we we went back to noumea.
Then we left at about four of the clock in the afternoon.
And the next morning about a few minutes before four a m we got torpedoed.
They got the four lifeboats off and and and running.
But the one i had chosen the the the ropes were stuck.
So somebody had a knife and cut them off.
So it it went down in ocean.
Then we were going down there.
Then it turned over.
So by that time the ship was out there just just you know across the streams.
And they went down.
You know it sunk.
So after awhile the one of the other boats came by.
There were three of us originally overturned lifeboat.
One one guy had a broken back.
Then a a a fourth guy he swimming over to our boat.
We were holding up a little flashlight.
We were not getting the overturned lifeboat because of the sharks you know and all that kind of stuff.
So finally they picked us up.
Course the torpedoes came at four in the morning you know.
So i celebrated my my birthday lifeboat.
We knew we were going to going to be rescued.
It it goes through the window from the outside.
It knocks over the lamp.
He has the the ball in his hands.
So he he probably is shouting out to to to the kid and through the window.
It does not show where the boy has gone.
It does not say whether they are related.
But well that is the way it goes.
Well the little boy is apparently going off to school.
His mother is is telling him he needs to take an umbrella.
But he did not want to do that.
So he throws it back into her hand.
And then he says goodbye.
He is walking along going to school.
It starts raining.
So he goes back to the house.
Then he goes off to school again.
It is raining.
He he looks like he is happy.
She was not allowed to go but her two sisters went.
And then a fairy came along.
And she created a a carriage and dressed cinderella up.
And she she was allowed to go.
She went to the the ball.
But she hadta be you know home by midnight.
And she had these glass slippers.
The that well dancing handsome prince you know.
And then she realized that she had hadta be home by midnight.
So in the hurry to to get home she lost one of her glass slippers.
So the prince did not know who she was.
So he went around the kingdom and with the glass slippers.
And looking for the girl who would fit.
So the it fit cinderella.
I guess they they they they tried ththem on the the the the two older sisters.
But they fit cinderella to it.
So i guess they married.
An lived happily ever after.
Well i would get out the bread to start with.
I take two slices and lay them face up on the kitchen counter.
I would spread peanut butter on one of them.
Then i just slap ththem together.
The family dog has chased the cat up a tree.
So the father has gone up the tree to try to rescue it.
But he finds that he is not able to get out that far on the limb.
But somebody has called the fire department.
They are going to rescue the cat.
So i was sposta be collecting interviews with people who would had those experiences.
When i first arrived in the area that i had chosen i had a great deal of trouble getting anybody to want to talk to me.
I learned later it was because some rumors had gone around about what this information was going to be used for.
But there was a navajo ceremony going on at the time.
I learned about this.
I i realized from all the experience on the reservation that if you are ever going to find a large population of people without very much to do it is it is sing as we call ththem.
So i went to the location of the sing.
I set up shop under a pinon tree.
I started trying to find people to talk to.
Well before very long the lead medicine man singer as we call him who was conducting the ceremony inside the the hut hogan learned about this.
He came out and asked me what was going on.
I explained why i was there.
Information was being collected.
So he asked me if i would come that night to the evening ceremony when everybody's standing in a big circle around a fire.
Explain about what i was doing there and why.
So i i came.
I i did a indeed make.
I made this speech about explaining the reason for my survey.
I was actually believe it or not given a round of applause afterward.
From that time onward i never had any trouble getting interviews.
So that stands out in my mind as an experience in my life.
Well a little boy is kicking a soccer ball.
He kicks it in the wrong direction.
Is going to fall in the lap of a man who is sitting in the chair on the inside.
He is standing at the window now.
He is holding the soccer ball.
The lady is offering her little boy an umbrella to go out.
But he says.
Nah i do not need it.
Then he sets forth.
Lo and behold it is raining.
He is getting wet.
He comes back in sort of bedraggled and sad and chagrined.
His mother gives him an umbrella.
He sets forth again with the umbrella.
Well there is a mean oldd lady.
She has two ornery selfish daughters.
A man who i assume is her husband brings a little girl home and.
She is going to be living with us.
She makes friends with the animals.
They all learn that there is going to be a ball.
The prince is going to marry whoever's foot will fit into this this glass slipper.
The mother and the daughters are thinking.
So they get ready.
They go off to the ball.
Well cinderella thinks.
Well gosh i would like to go too.
She goes and talks to a fairy godmother who fits her up with a real fancy ball dress.
Off she goes to the the party.
They also find that her her foot fits into the slipper.
But she has been told that she must got to got to go home by midnight.
So she leaves and goes home.
But somehow or other and i have forgotten how this works out now.
But they discover that she is the one whose foot fitted into the slipper.
So she marries the prince charming.
Want me to tell you?
Well if your going to do it the best way you are going to use really good bread like a a sourdough or a whole wheat.
It makes great improvement.
You are going to toast it.
No molasses no high fructose corn syrup.
You are going to have peanut butter that is very good grade.
That is going to have peanuts a dab of salt and nothing else added.
You are going to put that on the the toasted piece of bread.
Then if you want to add the jelly you are going to use a really good jelly like raspberry raspberry jam probably.
Put the stuff away that you got out otherwise.
The family that lives next door have several small children a dog and some aggravating characteristics.
Which took off up into the tree.
But the little girl got involved.
She is carrying on until you can hear her down the end of the block.
Her mother calls her husband.
Who gets up in the tree.
Let us the ladder get away from him.
She in aggravation and partial despair calls the fire department.
The firemen come.
The ladder that he brought is still on the ground.
The dog which has never been very nice natured is at the foot of the tree barking until you can hear him way down yonder.
He is accompanied by a bird that thinks this is great fun.
The little girl is still howling like mad.
The mother went back in the house because she could not tolerate all this uproar.
The firemen did their duty.
Only one of ththem got bitten.
The cat gave in.
Yielded to the firemen who plucked it out of the tree.
Nobody said thank you.
The uproar continued as the firemen drove away.
An occasion you are saying?
I have very good eye hand coordination if i do say so myself.
When i was in graduate school i was working on the venation of of fly wings.
I was working with the pupal wings.
So that as they were in the pupal case the wings were everted.
So i had pipettes.
Would try to blow air into them to get them to turn in the right direction.
Because that was long ago there was not equipment available.
So my dad made me some forceps.
He took copper strips and made the spring so that i had this bite on this long handle.
Had a very good microscope because it belonged to the university.
The specimens i had i grew my own.
Down in the part of the laboratory where the men working on the insecticides grew their cockroaches i grew my flies.
I grew the not the housefly the next one up.
It will come to me.
Anyway useta be a a joke to me.
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
The development of the individual parallels the development of the species.
So that what i was finding in the wings of these pupal flies was the pattern that would emerge as the adults.
You hadta determine whether this firm vein had this branch come off the bottom.
Or whether they were two separate branches starting back here together.
Then if you did you you got to explain why you thought this was so.
You explained what you saw.
I used a lot of poisonous stuff setting up my specimens.
But i survived.
One of the things that we used a lot was cyanide.
But the things that have come to the attention of scientists since then are probably equally toxic.
So we used the stuff.
We washed our hands.
We took good care of our specimens.
Woe betide us if anybody spilled anything bebecause.
But they made very very nice displays.
You had enough specimens that you could show the developing stages which i did.
Well the the thing that i was trying to achieve was to determine which ones that i thought were one and two.
But i have not touched it since.
I would like to because it was the last thing that we worked on before they developed the electron microscope.
I just think had i had the money or the exposure to the electron microscope that a done so much more.
However that may come in my future.
You do not go any further?
He got a little carried away.
He kicked it hard enough that it broke the window.
Not only the window but also docked over the table lamp inside breaking that also.
The adult person sitting in there was jarred awake.
That made him very aggravated.
He is yelling out through the gap in the window to.
We will straighten you out.
However somebody called and said.
But herbie still knew that something was coming that is not going to feel pretty good.
Mama has an umbrella.
Mama likes umbrellas.
She thinks they are very very practical.
He talks his way out of the house without taking the umbrella.
So when he comes back in the house mother is more than a little upset with him because he is all wet.
She knows that he could catch a cold.
He knows that she knows that that just might happen.
So they agreed for him to take the bumbershoot and go on his way.
While it did not solve the problem it redistributed it.
Back in the time that this story originated it was not a good position to be in because adults did not have good attitudes toward stepchildren and people who might interfere with the flow of money in and out of the family.
So there was to be a dance at the castle where the prince was.
The two sisters older than cinderella and their mother received an invitation to the dance.
So anyway they they are looking over their wardrobes trying to find out what they should wear.
Cinderella does not have much in the way of clothing.
So she is decorated with ashes and such from working in the kitchen because in the kitchen in those days you you used ashes for scouring powder.
It did not come off your hands very well.
So the the two stepsisters were so enchanted with their possibility of cornering the prince that they continued to snipe at at cinderella.
But they were so busy choosing what they were going to wear and that she only hadta do twice as much as usual in order to help them get ready for the the dance.
So sisters were dressed all up.
Mama acquired a coach from somebody to take the girls.
She led the way out.
They were really overdressed.
But you could not tell ththem that they did not look as great as they felt they did.
But they did not.
Once they got out of the house then cinderella dried her tears.
Her fairy godmother appeared on the scene.
They had used what they had on hands.
They mice took the place of the horses.
Anyway all these possessions were taken.
Cinderella's fairy busy busy busy making up things just so she would show up well.
She created with a her fairy wand the dress that cinderella would wear.
The lovely coats that the horses had.
So that they lined up at the door and with all these magical improvements.
The fairy godmother remembered to say.
You have got to come home by midnight because it all goes back to the way it was before when the clock goes.
As she got to the palace the prince saw her.
So she got to dance with the prince more than once.
The next thing you knew clock was striking.
So she runs out.
The prince tries to catch up with her.
All he sees is this ash girl running down the stairs.
Happened to be a glass slipper on the stairway where she had passed by.
He catches the slipper.
Tries to find who might have left behind.
Well nobody fit it.
So they made arrangements to visit the community out beyond the the castle.
All the young ladies were going to try on the slipper.
But they were going to try the shoe on anyway.
There were sort of some hard feelings about who got to put the shoe on and and so forth.
Once once they got to cinderella's house.
She tried on the shoe.
It fit.
Her fairy godmother appeared.
She got to go up to the castle with the prince with the two not quite so attractive sisters running along behind.
Once cinderella was introduced to the king and the queen.
The prince says.
I am having her and nobody else.
The other shoe appeared.
A good time was had by all.
First i would get the bread out of the package.
Then i would get a knife.
I would get the peanut butter first with the two pieces of bread that i had.
I would spread one side with peanut butter and the other side with jelly.
I would put the sandwich back together.
Oh wait i would put it on a plate.
Did i forget the plate?
Then it would be ready for a four yearold or a six yearold or any other age who wanted to eat it.
This is a story of a cat which went up a tree and got out on a limb.
So here i am looking at the father who is climbed the tree.
There is a dog at the bottom of the tree barking up the father.
The father is desperately trying to think of some way to get to the cat.
In the meantime there is a daughter who is out under the tree waving her arms in the air trying to do something about the cat.
It is not doing any good.
They are trying to come over and see what they could do about this cat.
Who knows how this particular story is going to end.
I would like to tell you about a friend of mine that i met when i was a young mother.
She had a daughter the same age of mine.
I i came to know her because we each had a child in brownies.
We we really liked each other from the get go.
But what i came to find out about her was that she was jewish.
Thank goodness she she managed to make it through.
She was on one of the first boats out to this country because she had relatives who would come over generations earlier in in chicago.
She ended up in paducah kentucky.
We liked each other so very much that we became scout troop leaders together.
In the process of all this of all the planning we spent a lot of time together.
She told me much about her life in germany and about the terrible terrible times of the holocaust.
One of the things that i remember vividly the only reason that she really lasted her mother was gentile.
The line goes through the mothers if you probably know this.
The jewish jewish line goes through the mothers.
He was the police officer in the town where she lived.
So he was able to keep her off the list of the children who were going off to the concentration camps.
But finally at the end he could not do it anymore.
She told me one time which just broke my heart he sent her and her three siblings off to concentration camp.
But he would not look at them or at mother.
The mother and the father managed to stay in dresden.
They were both killed in the fire bombing in dresden just before the war was over.
It was not something that happened to me.
But it was something that i became very much involved in because i listened to her stories.
She did not just tell me the story.
It was things she just told me little by little.
Finally in the village where she grew up.
They they had asked her to come back.
They wanted her to come back.
They would pay her you know to get her to come.
She would not go.
She would not go.
She talked to me about it a lot.
She finally decided she would go.
She did not think it was a very good idea.
But she went.
When she came back she said.
I am glad i went.
A youngster is practicing with his soccer ball in in his own yard i would imagine because hedge right there.
But the soccer ball went over that hedge into a window in the house next door.
We see this husband young man father whoever he is.
He the ball hits him in his lap.
He looks at this big hole in his window.
He says.
Wait til i catch that youngster.
A momma and her little boy are chatting with each other.
He is about to go to school i think.
She thinks it is going to rain.
So she offers him an umbrella.
He says.
Oh no i do not need an umbrella.
So he marches right out.
What do you know?
It starts to rain.
He covers his head with his hands.
He rushes back to the house.
His mother looks like.
Well i told you so.
But she gives him the umbrella.
He starts out again.
He is so happy because he is got an umbrella over his head.
He is going to go to school.
Once upon a time there was a family.
There was a mother and a father and a daughter.
The the mother died.
The father went out.
He found another wife.
He brought his new wife in.
But she had two daughters.
Cinderella who had been the joy of her mother and father was suddenly relegated to the cinders.
She hadta do all the chores for her two stepsisters.
Her stepmother did not think much of her either.
So she just had a terrible time.
Then in this kingdom where cinderella lived a a king.
He decided that it was time for his son to get married.
So he sent out an edict that all the eligible young attractive women kingdom would come for a ball.
They would have a ball on a certain night.
So the invitations went out to all and sundry.
He came to the house where cinderella lived with her two stepsisters.
So but they got really excited.
Oh they thought it would just be wonderful to have marvelous new clothes and marvelous this marvelous that.
Cinderella got excited too.
She thought it would be just great.
But she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the ball.
She would hafta help her sisters get ready.
So the night came.
They got themselves ready.
They went off in a carriage.
They were you know looking looking down their nose at her.
All of a sudden a fairy godmother showed up and touched her with a wand.
She turned into to this beautiful dress.
Then there was a pumpkin.
She turned that into a coach.
Then there were some mice.
She turned that into the horses.
She made this beautiful thing cinderella who was not going to get to go to the ball.
She had on these lovely little glass slippers.
But she said.
The one thing you cannot stay out after midnight.
So when the clock starts to strike you got to leave.
You have got to go before the clock starts to strike.
So she went to the ball.
When she got there the prince saw her.
He looked took one look.
He just fell in love.
So he found her.
Everybody else just hadta stand back and wait because that is all he could do was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found.
They danced and they danced all over the place.
Everybody else was sort of put to the side.
But you know what?
She forgot that she hadta leave at midnight.
So the clock started to strike.
She remembered.
So she started flying down the steps to leave.
But she lost a slipper.
She flew out the door.
By this time her carriage had turned into a pumpkin.
Her horsemen had turned into mice.
But she finally got home.
I have forgotten exactly how.
But she got home.
The other two daughters came home.
Well of course they had the story to tell.
He said.
We are trying to find the girl who belongs to this slipper.
Of course the stepmother said.
Oh you go back to the kitchen into the cinders.
We cannot foo with you.
He tried it on the other two girls.
Then he he said.
Let me try it on you.
So he did.
It fit.
So they married.
They lived happily ever after.
I it took.
I would start with the choice of bread.
I would get out the peanut butter.
I would choose whether i wanted chunky peanut butter or plain peanut butter.
I do not make it with butter underneath.
Whatever kind of jelly i had i put on top of that.
I would probably not put more peanut butter on the top layer.
Cut it in half so i could eat it easy.
Obviously father has come out to with his ladder to try to climb up and entice the cat to come down.
The ladder has slipped away.
So the father is caught up in the tree.
Somehow the firemen had been notified.
They have come with a ladder and will be taking the cat down.
The little girl is begging for it.
Even the bird is singing in the tree.
And we did not know each other too long.
We met on campus.
But when we decided i was playing in my home church.
I lived three miles from school.
So i would come home on weekends and play.
When we decided to get married i sort of surprised myself i think by saying i would.
But they they had gone together five years before they got married.
So i just thought it.
You you always dated somebody a long time you know before you got married.
It seemed well sort of ridiculous for me.
You know that just was not me.
He lived thirty miles away from school when we lived there in seattle.
So we drove up.
And then we moved to.
My mother had passed away when i was nineteen.
So he would never met my mother.
But my father was a hard working man.
But i i have a brother two years younger.
So when donnie asked told my dad that he you know wanted.
Or i guess i told him i said.
Well he wants to get married and move away.
Well my father just said.
Let us have something to eat.
He hides it cooking.
It kind of overwhelmed him because he would he would be by himself with my brother you know.
So we went to to the minister of the church where i played.
Of course i go in.
I told him we wanted to come in on saturday and get married.
"Bebecause, as my father said you know he would like to give me a wedding."
Since my mother was not alive that did not seem very good.
So we said we would coming like on a saturday to get married.
The minister says.
We are not having any shoddy affair.
There is an oh so and very stubborn you know.
But you know we we could not really afford that anything.
You were going to be doomed you know if you were not married.
So we decided and all his relatives wanted to help and that was fun.
I played the organ for the most part in the service.
Then we got up and got married and went downstairs after the wedding.
Somebody else played the post hymn for me.
We went downstairs and and had a nice reception because all these people got it together.
You know somebody did flowers.
So i have always felt like i let my dad down pretty much bebecause he was on his own.
Some of the relatives thought they said.
Well you are not planning to go.
You know when my mother died said.
You are not planning to go to college now.
You are going to stay home take care of your dad.
I got.
I was going to stay home and cook meals for my father who worked long hours as a blacksmith.
Of course right off the bat it goes through the window.
Hits hits the lamp.
The man who is sitting there next to the window in a chair seems to be surprised.
I suspect that perhaps that is his own son.
He is looking to see what kind of a punishment if any he might throw out.
She is obviously heard the weather report and hands the umbrella.
He he resists it.
No kid wants an umbrella.
So he happily waves goodbye to his mother.
Does not get too far before the raindrops come.
Uhoh what do i do now?
He is getting wetter and wetter.
He gets part way.
But he turns around.
His mother looks at him.
He goes off very happily having taken the advice.
Well there is this a the kingdom of something where are they.
The there was a a father and a stepmother with her two daughters who were highly favored but not nearly as attractive as cinderella.
Apparently i believe she she might have been the original daughter but i am not sure about that.
They all took advantage of her and made her work.
They did not hafta.
And she was to tend the fire and hadta wait on them all constantly.
This went on.
But she she loved the animals.
Everybody liked cinderella.
However and then there was this castle.
I think it was the royal castle decided to have a dance and a party i think.
So invitations went out.
Of course the stepmother and the stepdaughters decided oh of course they were going to the dance.
But and cinderella was obviously not asked.
But she found apparently had some trunks where she had some clothes hidden and very pretty dress.
She put it on.
Maybe she expected to go or maybe she was encouraged to go by the animals.
But when she went in to show them they started ripping her clothing jewels and clothes off of her and telling her she was not to go.
She was not going to be able to go to the dance.
She dressed up and and was taken by all these the animal friends and so forth to the dance.
When she arrived of course the stepsisters were very unhappy that she was there.
There was a a prince.
They were all going to see if they could win his favor.
Well he he sought cinderella out.
But she was told by the fairy godmother that she hadta be home by midnight or she would turn into a pumpkin or something.
So she she looked up at the clock.
She was having a good time dancing with the prince.
She hadta leave.
They whisked her away.
She lost one of her shoes and left it at the dance.
She arrived home.
Well the prince wanted to find this girl who fit the shoe.
He sent out a search party.
They took the shoe around.
Of course the stepsisters both were hoping that the shoe would fit them.
They tried it on.
It did not fit.
Naturally it fit cinderella.
So they obviously got to get happily ever after as far as i.
Okay it seems to be a pretty spring day.
The birds are singing.
The tree is leafed out.
So it is it is beginning to be almost summer time.
The little girl's kitty cat has climbed up in the tree.
She cannot get it.
So she is parked her tricycle.
Her daddy has come out.
He is climbed up on the tree.
But he cannot seem to get as far out as the cat is.
Now the neighbor's dog has gotten into the act.
He is come over.
He is not going to let the daddy down out of the tree.
So the firemen have come with their ladder.
They are going to rescue the kitty cat and the daddy.
Okay i i can turn this into quite a story.
I would take the slices of bread out of the bread wrapper two slices and the jar of peanut butter out of the cupboard and the jelly out of the refrigerator.
I would put a little peanut butter on both slices.
Then i would cut it this way and this way and this way and this way.
I did that.
Well i had one thing that to me is the high point of my entire life.
It happened twenty four years ago.
We were at the hospital with my daughter and my son inlaw expecting their first baby.
They of course went back.
They my son inlaw came out.
He said.
You all can come back and visit a little while.
So we went back.
We were all talking.
All of a sudden she had pain which that happens.
Her father immediately jumped up.
He said.
I will go back out to the waiting room.
I said.
Okay we we will do that then.
He was not good seeing his baby daughter suffer.
So we got up to to go back out.
My son inlaw got a very stricken look on his face.
He said.
You are not going to leave me are you?
I said.
Oh darling you do not want me here.
You certainly do not want your mother inlaw here.
He said.
Yes i do.
Gordon said.
Why do not i go back to the apartment.
You stay here with the children.
Then you can call me when it gets here and tell me what it is.
I looked at rick.
He said.
Yeah why do not you do that.
I said.
Well it took all night long.
We just had the most delightful evening.
Pam was not enjoying it all that much.
When the baby really started to come.
I wanted it to be a girl.
We are all named for my father.
We carry his family name down.
I wanted this one the first grandchild to be a girl so i could have the name carried down again.
Pam had had an ultrasound.
They told her it was a boy.
She was so afraid i was going to be disappointed.
I was looking and looking and trying to see.
Finally the doctor looked up at me.
He said.
Grandmother if you would move back just a little bit i might be able to catch this baby when it comes out.
So we laughed.
He did catch the baby.
But when it came out it was my girl.
They made a mistake on the ultrasound.
So i my and to be there and to actually see her born.
Of course the doctor gave her to rick first.
Then rick gave her to me.
So i laughingly say i always love my son inlaw but never quite as much as i did that night.
He really became mine that night.
I just stay on this page?
He is kicking his soccer ball.
As little boys will do and as soccer balls will do it went through the window.
Not only did it break the window but it hit the lamp.
I am thinking perhaps it was the neighbor maybe not the daddy.
The neighbor has the soccer ball.
He is looking at his window.
I think he is deciding on whether he will wait to get his window paid for and then return the soccer ball perhaps.
His mother says.
You best take your umbrella.
He says.
Oh no mother i do not need my umbrella.
He leaves.
He gets down the street a little ways.
So he turns around and hurries back home as fast as he can.
Mother's looking at him.
She says.
See i told you so.
But she gives him the umbrella.
He takes back off for school a little bit later but a little bit drier now.
Well there was a the daddy and the little girl.
Her apparently they lost the mother.
The daddy remarried.
He married a lady with two daughters.
Of course the lady loved her two daughters much more than she did ella.
But when daddy went away apparently he traveled in his works some way.
At least he went away and left ella with with the stepmother and the two stepsisters.
She made cinderella do all the work and sleep by the fireplace and sit by the cinders.
So they called her cinderella.
She hadta wait on the daughters.
In the disney version which is the book the little mice came around.
They helped her.
The birds came and helped her with her work.
There was to be a ball at the castle.
Of course the two stepsisters were going.
Cinderella hadta get ththem ready.
She wanted to go.
But the stepmother said no.
Unless she could manage everything on her own would be the only way she could go.
The little birds and the animals came to her rescue.
They helped her make a dress and everything.
So then the fairy godmother came.
She fixed her a a pumpkin and turned it into a coach.
So the the fairy godmother gave her the the slippers to wear.
Told her she could have a wonderful time at the ball but she must be home at midnight because everything else would return back at midnight.
So she went off to the ball and met the prince.
The prince fell in love with her.
All of a sudden the clock began to strike.
She took off.
She hadta run to get away.
She dropped a slipper on the stairs.
The other stepsisters were so disappointed because the prince did not pay attention to them.
They only only the strange princess that nobody knew.
So a day or so later the prince went from house to house with the slipper trying to find the girl that could wear it.
Some of the the stepsisters tried it on.
But they could not get their foot into it.
I think even the stepmother tried to get it on.
She could not get her foot in it.
So cinderella asked if she might try it.
They let her.
Her little foot slipped right in.
She reached in her pocket.
The prince loved her and married her.
They lived happily ever after.
First i would find some white bread two slices.
With a spatula smear some of each onto the white bread.
The father has gone with a ladder to rescue the cat.
But the ladder has dropped away from the tree.
The dog is barking at bottom of the tree.
Fortunately the fire department has been called.
They arrive with the ladder in tow.
There was a lot of information in the papers about the tall ships that were invited from many many countries to parade and celebrate the holiday with the americans.
Sailors meaning we went on vacations where we could sail boats.
We thought that would be great to somehow get on one of those tall ships and take part in that.
So unknown to us our secretary at the time knew about this and heard us talking about it.
She without knowing telling us about it wrote to seven or eight countries.
We have these two fellas that would like very much to join on your tall ship as they pass.
She told us later nine out of ten came back one one at a time.
She was about to give up when the last one came in from portugal.
It said.
So we could not believe it.
We thought she was kidding us you know because we were so excited.
Well it turns out she showed us the letter.
All it said was that the ship was going to be in bermuda at a certain date.
That is all there was.
So we get all excited.
Quick found out we could make air airline reservations.
Bebecause we hadta fly to bermuda.
We did that.
We knew from the time we would get there it would be relatively dark.
We would not never find the ship.
Bebecause they were all anchored out.
So we stayed overnight.
The next morning we went down to the water's edge in hamilton beach.
Fortunately we did see a bunch of rowboats that were going back and forth to the ships that anchored.
So they all hadta work very very hard putting the sails up and down and so on.
So fortunately we noticed one of those ships had the name sagres sagres sagres on the side.
So i tried to and i tried to talk to the sailors like.
But they did not speak english.
We sure did not speak portuguese.
So finally i just just said.
They they motion jump in.
They rowed us out to the ship with our suitcase.
Fortunately the officer of the day was looking over the edge.
He said.
So we knew we were alright.
So we got on board.
The rest of the time was spent two weeks sailing from bermuda to new york harbor.
Then the fourth of july we went up the hudson river with a spring of ships behind us and ahead of us from about fifty countries.
They turned around up there and came back down again.
We went down to new york city proper in one of the piers.
We said.
Unfortunately it crashes through the window.
Greatly upsets a man who is sitting in the chair.
He stands up with the ball in his hand.
A young school boy getting ready to go to school.
His mother thinks it is going to rain.
So she says.
But being impetuous he says.
I do not need an umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
He starts off to school.
Sure enough it starts to rain.
He runs back home.
By now he is soaking wet.
Now he takes the umbrella.
Cinderella is a poor little young lady who was relegated to that of a domestic in a house with two sisters and a mother.
But they regard her as not worthy.
There is a ball to be held.
She wants to go.
But of course her stepmother will not allow her to go or have a dress.
She wants one of the two daughters to go.
Her fairy godmother shows up.
Says that she will make it possible for her to go.
They turn her pumpkin into a coach.
Four mice into horses to pull the coach.
She obtains a beautiful gown to wear.
I cannot remember where she gets that.
She is picked up in the horse and the carriage by a suitor.
A tall dark handsome man takes her to the the ball in the coach.
She says.
I hafta be back by midnight.
The clock strikes twelve eventually.
What happens is the coach becomes a pumpkin again.
The four horses become mice.
She runs off to get home.
But she leaves her slipper behind.
So the hero of the story finds the slipper.
He sets out to find the girl whose foot would fit the slipper.
Of course the stepmother wants it to be one of the the daughters.
It turns out he tries it on cinderella.
Lo and behold it fits.
They live happily ever after.
I would get the components necessary to produce it.
I would make sure i had a knife a jar of peanut butter and two pieces of bread.
I would open the peanut butter.
The dog came out and ran her cat up the tree.
The father has gone up the tree to get the cat.
Then in the meantime they have called the fire department.
The fire department has arrived.
Evidently the father had a ladder to get up in the tree because there is a ladder laying on the ground by the little girl.
There is a trike there.
The howling man.
I do not know whether he is howling at the man or the cat.
But it will be taken care of.
There is a bird singing about the whole program.
They will be taken care of bebecause the fire department's there.
You hadta be young and dumb to even be on there.
Even if you had any brain you would not be on there.
You hadta be young and dumb.
I was raised in a little country town and went to louisville maybe twice in my life.
Bebecause in the meantime i had married and had a a daughter.
Another one was coming home from korea the war korean war.
I seemed to get along pretty good with the powers that be.
And feel like that i was wanted and needed and doing a good job.
Another high point was i ended up working for calvin manufacturing company a very very large blue jeans manufacturer actually here in kentucky.
I ended up being vice president in charge of sales.
Now that made me happy.
It also made me a little money.
Made it so that i could retire.
I have been retired twenty four years.
I am still making it.
But i have had so many good things happen to me.
They always center the bad things so much that i i never even.
They do not enter my mind.
I got so many more pluses than i have had minuses.
You have no idea the life i have lived.
I worked.
But i also traveled all over the country in airplanes.
I worked to do it.
They do not do it for free you hafta produce.
I sold them jeans and took their money.
Kid kicks a ball.
Must have no idea where he is kicking it.
It dudn't land in his lap it knocks over a lamp.
Now where the kid's gone i do not know.
It would been me i would been gone.
He is sitting there whatchacallit holding the ball.
Well it looks like it tells itself.
Here is a nice young child asking his mother for an unbrella.
He is got the unbrella.
Her his mother takes it away from hi am.
Next picture says he would like to have the unbrella back.
He lost that deal.
He is shown walking with a backpack on and not an unbrella.
It starts sprinkling.
The next one shows it is even sprinkling more so.
He turns around and looks as if he is headed home.
He gets home and he is wet.
His mother's looking at him in a questionable way.
But this final thing is he is got the unbrella out in the rain.
He is moving on.
He seems to be happy.
Got a happier face in number six than he does in number three.
I remember cinderella.
Well i am going to tell the story as i know it.
I i i did not quite understand the first opening of that book cinderella meeting the the two other children.
But i do know that for her her stepmother who had two daughters.
They did not have the class or the looks or anything that cinderella had.
She was hustling those two girls and making cinderella work.
Cinderella looks out the window one day.
And sees the castle where the knight lives.
He is looking for bride.
I have the silver slipper.
He is got a a glass slipper i think it was.
Cinderella you know when she rode in her pumpkin was told that she hadta leave the ball by midnight.
She had on a pair of glass slippers i think.
They were just doing beautifully ball.
Cinderella knew what that meant.
She had been warned.
So she runs out of the ball.
In in in the process of doing that a shoe.
So the pumpkin the the beautiful coach became a pumpkin again.
The horses faded away.
Cinderella became a chimney sweep again.
He is coming down.
He is trying that shoe on all of the available ladies.
In the process of it cinderella gets her foot in it.
Of course hers is the foot that fit in there.
One thing led to another.
The next thing you know they are tieing all up.
They live happily ever after.
There was a few birds out.
Our cat sam had gone up a tree.
He would not come down.
So dad got a ladder which was really too short.
But he ended up shimmying on up the tree and sitting there.
Now we have the trouble of getting the cat down and getting dad down.
I was standing there underneath the cat.
I would been riding my tricycle.
We called the fire department.
They came with a ladder to get me down.
There you go.
Well first you would hafta select the the type of bread that you would want.
Myself i like the german bread.
Then you have a choice to make between creamy or crunchy.
So i get the crunchy peanut butter.
I put it on fairly thick.
Then we hafta select the jelly.
You would want something that did not have seeds in it because that gets to be a problem when eating crunchy peanut butter.
So we get out the preserves without seeds.
You spread it on top of the peanut butter.
You put a top on it.
You cut it quarterly.
You enjoy.
I remember as a child we would go to church sunday sunday school.
Wednesday we would go to bible study.
I never thought anything about it.
In nineteen fifty one president truman decided i was going to korea.
But anyway i went.
We moved around quite a bit.
We had no religious services.
After about a year or so they sent a chaplain.
He came out on a hillside.
We had services.
We had communion.
I always think of that when i have communion that that is the most meaningful thing to me.
I never thought much about it as a child.
You mean one page?
He was doing a good job until he went through mister brown's window.
The bad thing about it the ball went through the window.
It hit mister brown.
But he held on to my soccer ball.
It was raining.
Mom said.
You are going to hafta take an umbrella.
He wanted no nothing to do with that.
So he takes off without the umbrella.
Wet he got.
So he came home.
His mother was very aggravated with him because he got wet.
He was sold on the idea of using an umbrella.
Well dad after mom died he married this woman.
Then pretty soon dad died.
But my stepmother had these two daughters gertrude and samantha.
She would do everything to help them out.
There was going to be a ball.
It seems like that that at the ball the prince was going to select somebody to be his bride.
Then i knew i could not go.
But behold here come my fairy godmother.
She came out.
She fixed me up with a gown.
I think it was from victoria.
Is that what it is called?
So i ended up going to the ball.
The story was from my godmother that i hadta be back at midnight.
Well at eleven forty eight it was getting down to the time i hadta leave.
I cut out.
But behold i lost one of my shoes.
Well it ended up the prince found that shoe.
He decided that cinderella who he danced with several times.
He did not care for them other two girls because one thing they had bad odor about ththem.
They did not want to mess with that.
So he go around to all the young ladies in the village to see who would fit that shoe.
So he came over to my stepmother and tried on the shoes.
Then they tried ththem on cinderella.
Behold they fit.
That was a happy ending bebecause then i become a princess.
Betty's family had a dog in the family.
They decided that they needed a cat too.
So the dog would have a a companion.
So when the dog got after the cat the cat got scared run up the tree.
The father went up the tree to get to the the cat out.
His ladder fell off.
He is stuck.
So somebody the neighbor i i suppose called the fire department.
They came and got the man and the cat both out of the tree.
Well first i would choose some peanut butter.
Which kind i like.
Then i would take my favorite jelly.
If i was going to make one i would use the grape jelly.
I would take a knife.
Then i would put some butter on each side.
I would grill it.
Then i would eat it while it was hot.
The saddest thing that ever happened to me was with my husband.
He volunteered for the navy when he was the week after he was seventeen i think.
He went into the service and and stayed two years.
Because his ship was leaving out they gave him a discharge and the two years.
At that time you hadta join two years.
He was in the tomic test when the the bomb was let off.
He took the sailors to the bikini where they had taken them off of that island because of the radiation that would be happening.
He took them over there.
Many of time he is pulled ththem out of the water where they were drinking.
Well he developed cancer.
When we got he got back to the shore his ship had a two hundred and some foot slash on it i think it was.
Well they took all the sailors and they let them go off in in california for r and r.
So they came home with geiger counters.
The geiger counters went on that ship.
It went all the way out.
It could not even take the radiation amount on that was on the ship that they were on.
Well they went out and gathered all of those men up.
The the captain was taken off and taken somewhere else.
They never saw him again.
Well when my husband came home he had radiation sickness which they told him was ulcerous.
He was doctored for it for i do not know how many years.
Then he developed cancer from from that.
He had his lung removed.
When he had it removed in the hospital they were going to teach me how to irrigate him.
He had be irrigated bebecause they had done a.
Well i am getting a little ahead of myself.
First the they taught me how to irrigate it.
And they told showed me how to do it and all.
We went home on christmas eve.
He did not even know where he was at really.
They developed a staph infection into his lung cavity when they doing the surgery.
So they he hadta go back to the hospital.
And then when they were teaching me how to.
They did the constant irrigation and killed all the red cells in his lung cavity.
But i i i can live it over.
There is so much that happened it is hard to remember exactly how it happened and bebecause it happened so many times.
But they did the constant irrigation and killed all of those cells.
There was nothing in there.
So they put over ten thousand dollars worth of medication into his lung cavity to kill that.
Well when we went home on christmas eve he was bacteria free.
But they taught me how to irrigate it.
There was a container sitting there.
I said.
I have never done this before.
Never watched ththem do it.
So she said.
I am going to show you how.
She said.
I have never done it before either.
I said.
If you have not done it before do you know what to do?
She said.
Oh i know what to do.
So she showed me how to irrigate it and how to care of it.
So when we got through there was another container sitting there.
I said.
My husband said.
Surely you have not put something into my back that is not right.
So the doctor came in at that time.
I said.
He is afraid that we put something contaminated into his lung cavity.
So he goes out and gets the head nurse.
She comes up does a ifferent another she goes and cleans it out again.
She said.
I do not like doing this twice so soon.
But i feel like i should.
They called me.
He told me that he was shaking the bed.
He was jerking so.
Well he said.
I called the doctor.
He said.
We run into that nurse in the hospital before we got into the doctor's office.
She smelled it the area.
She said.
They had killed all of those blood cells in there no hope.
So he hadta wear a tube.
They said it would be in there for years.
So this goes on for eight years.
They i had them change the the bandage and and clean out that area every day to give him peace and quiet.
At first i was sposta go to the hospital every time to get the the the the catheter and all changed because it was a procedure that hadta be done in the hospital.
She kept wanting me to go va because he was a veteran and get the things over there.
They had a bacteria committee over there that might be able to help him.
So we go over there.
While we were in this office there was this cabinet there.
They had tape silk tape in it and it was wide.
So i asked the nurse.
I said.
Where do you get that wide tape?
I said.
I only find the narrow.
It takes so much of it to get it bandaged up.
We were paying over two hundred or close to three hundred dollars at that time a month for his supplies.
She said.
You can have anything you want.
Well the doctor had told me before we went over there that it was procedure that he would.
He knew i could do it.
But he would not give it to me because it was a procedure done in hospital.
So when she told me i could have anything i wanted i told her what size catheter i wanted sterilized pins and and the solution to to irrigate with.
Everything that he needed.
The and and the sterilized gloves and all.
So i go home.
The first time it needed to be irrigated i do it myself.
After i got through i sat there could not get up because i thought if i that pin that went down into his cavity they would hafta do surgery to get go in there to get in out.
But he said i did much better job than they did at the hospital.
It did not hurt him.
So i thought.
Well i am going to do it again then.
So i got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through through them to keep it from falling down into his lung cavity.
That way i managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back.
He weighed two hundred and some pounds.
And then he went down to a hundred and twenty six when he went left the hospital.
He gained back nobody knew that he was sick.
The doctor said that he could not have lived if it had not been for me.
The the the doctor said the only thing they could do is go in there clean that cavity out and put in marbles in there to build it up to where he would have more stability.
I says.
I will never agree to that.
They they had a whole group of doctors around the bed.
He said.
I said.
That is what happened before.
I said.
I will clean it every day the rest of my life before i let that marbles be put in there.
Them them contaminating that area.
The doctor put his arm around my shoulders.
He said.
He said.
You said exactly what i wanted you to do.
So we did not have it done.
He he lived eight years that he would not have had for the the doctor said for the care that i gave him.
So during that time the i i started to change the the the tube.
I could not get it in.
It scared me to death.
So i called the surgeon which was a a a cousin of his to tell him that i could not get the tube back in.
He said.
Go over to the hospital and let them do it.
Well i took all of the things that was sterilized and told the the doctor at the hospital what to do.
He could not do it.
So he goes up to the fifth floor to get a surgeon.
He comes down.
I says.
No you cannot use those.
Those are not sterilized.
He said.
It would not hurt him if i picked up something off of the floor and put it in his back.
I said.
Let me tell you right now.
He is laying there because of your negligence.
He looked back at me.
The two nurses is standing there she they looked at me.
He left out the room.
He he told the man to go get him some sterilized scissors.
He turned around and looked at me.
And so he took those scissors.
He was going into his back and was going to stretch that area to try to get that that open so he could get the tube in.
I says.
You call his doctor right now.
So he left the room.
He said.
I am going to take him up for xray.
The doctor wants you come in on monday.
To a scan done.
The nurses says.
I told them about what had happened.
And they said.
I said.
But he needs help.
So they took him upstairs.
The doctor had us go over there.
We never saw that doctor again.
Do not know what happened to him.
I think he would lost his job.
I do not know.
But i was not about to let my husband go through another ordeal of their negligence.
So anyway it was not about a month that after that i developed hepatitis.
He hadta stay and take care of me.
I was put to bed.
He hadta wait on me.
I could not even lift a cup.
He healed his back is the way i feel.
That the doctor said it would be there the rest of his life.
Healed his back so he could take care of me.
Then as soon as i went back to work.
They told me i would never work again.
I went back to work because they said he would be better if i was working.
So i went back to work.
He developed cancer of a different kind in the other lung.
And he did the radiation treatment on that.
A month from the day finished the radiation he died.
Oh you want me to tell this one now?
I think i am ready.
This little boy got a soccer ball as a gift for his birthday.
I do not know whether he got any instructions with it or not bebecause he was out playing close to the window.
He kicked it.
It went right through the window either into his father's lap or into his neighbor's.
He stood up and held the ball.
I do not know whether the little boy got it back or not.
The mother got her umbrella out and gave it to the boy.
He was getting ready to go to school.
She says.
I do not want you to get wet.
Nope i do not want it.
It is not going to rain.
You just keep it.
So he goes out.
What happens?
It is startins to rain.
He is getting wet.
He is walking through the water and getting his feet wet and his head wet.
He goes home.
His mother's mad because he comes in soaked.
What does she do?
She changes his clothes for him.
They had two girls.
They made her do everything for ththem.
She hadta do everything.
They were going to be have a ball.
So they wanted to go and be elaborate and be the bell of the ball.
One night this fairy godmother came.
So she told her.
She said.
Now i am going to use this magic wand.
I am going to dress you.
You are going to be beautiful.
You are going to have a ride.
She made a a a putkin ride with the horses and everything.
You are going to the ball.
You are going to have a good time.
She had on glass sipper slippers.
So she goes.
She meets the prince.
They have a good time.
The two stepsisters were they they they were really mad at her because the prince was paying attention to her instead of them.
So she got busy and having such a good time she forgot what time it was.
She looked up.
It is chiming you know one two three.
She lost her slipper there.
So the prince found this glass slipper.
He went through the town trying it on for everybody.
Nobody could wear it.
They tried to pries their feet into it.
So he saw cinderella over here with her work clothes on.
He said.
You come try it.
They said.
No she did not go.
She she cannot try it.
He said.
But i want everybody to try it on.
He slipped it on real easy.
He found her.
He would been looking for her.
He found her.
The family dog is barking up the tree.
So the father gets the ladder.
Well then he loses his ladder.
It falls down.
He has no way to get up.
But the little girl in the meantime is still screaming for him to get the cat down.
There is no way that s put the ladder up.
So they call the fire department.
Who brings in the ladder.
Who puts up the ladder.
Well i would go to the refrigerator where i keep the bread.
Then i would take out two slices of bread.
I would trim off the crusts on ththem.
Then i would take out the peanut butter and the jelly.
I would put the peanut buttey on both slices of bread.
Then i would put jelly on both slices of bread.
Then i put the two slices of bread together.
Then i would slice it diagonally and down the middle.
Well a few years ago i was working in an antique shop over in georgetown.
The people in georgetown said the place was haunted.
I did not believe it.
People would come in from out of town and say.
There are voices upstairs.
Can you hear?
I would go upstairs.
I could hear nothing.
Some people would come in.
Soon as they step in the building they say.
I am leaving.
They would turn around and leave.
Fact one lady stepped about three or four steps in the door.
She started screaming.
She grabbed her purse.
I still never heard anything.
We had a lace curtain on the front door.
All of a sudden the lace curtain started raising up and up and ascending.
It went up very very slowly.
Then when it got about four feet it just stood there in the air for about thirty seconds.
Then it went just down as slowly as it came up.
Then when the curtain got even with the door it started just doing up and down somebody was standing on each side of it with their hands jerking it up and down.
How many more stories am i going to hafta tell?
Do i start?
This little boy is playing.
Anyway but he is playing with his foot.
So he kicks the ball.
He kicks it right through the window.
It lands on his father's leg.
His the father comes out.
Well right now the this little boy is going out.
His mother wants him to take an umbrella.
Because she says.
It is going to rain.
He said.
It is not raining.
I am not going to take an umbrella.
Well after he gets out it starts sprinkling a little rain.
He runs back.
He tells his mother.
She looks at him.
But anyway she gives him the umbrella.
I am going to ask you to tell a story.
Yes i have heard the story of cinderella.
Well i do not remember the story of cinderella very well.
Except cinderella was a little girl that lived with her stepmother and her stepsisters.
She hadta do all the work.
Well one day the stepmother said that there was going to be a dance.
That the prince was going to be there.
Anyway cinderella she goes up to the attic.
While she is up there she sees some beautiful clothes.
Her fairy godmother appears to her.
Then she has a coach and and it is little mice that take her to the dance.
But she hasta be home by twelve of the clock.
So when the clock strikes twelve she tells the prince she hasta leave.
But she loses her shoe on the way.
But anyway she gets home by twelve.
The next day the prince is looking for the the girl who was at the dance cinderella.
He he has her shoe.
So he tries the shoe on everybody in the village.
It finally fits cinderella.
Then the prince meets her.
They marry.
I would get the bread out of the bread wrapper.
I would take the peanut butter.
Hoping it is at room temperature spread it on the bread.
Then i would top it with some jam or some jelly.
Well in the beginning it looks like the cat climbed up on the tree.
The little girl got upset.
So she tried to get her dad to help her get the cat down.
But then the ladder fell off out from under that he used.
The dog's at the tree barking.
The firemen come with a ladder to help get down the dad and the cat.
Well i think of the people today and all of problems they have with health insurance.
When i was a kid my mother sent me in to empty a pan of boiling mashed potatoes.
She and my dad knew that the handle was loose.
I went and dumped it.
But it dumped all over my hand.
That terrified me not because it hurt.
But because my father had given more lectures than normal on not having to call the doctor.
I apologized to him for burning my hand because he would hafta take me to the doctor.
That is carrying things too far in my book.
He never questioned when i was hurt again.
He is playing kickball in the backyard.
The ball goes through the living room or his home window.
I do not know that it was living room.
But since father's sitting in the chair it ends up in his lap.
I am assuming it is the family room or living room.
The father gets up.
Looking to see who kicked the ball.
I say “father” but it does not really say it is his son.
It looks like mother's heard that there is going to be possible rain today.
So she tries to get the child to take an umbrella.
The child does not want to take an umbrella and says.
Then he gets on the way to school.
It starts to rain.
It starts to rain harder.
So he runs back home all drenched.
Cinderella came into a house with a mother that had two other daughters.
Cinderella therefore was made to do all types of housework.
All the other things the jobs that she the others did not want to do.
Eventually it became known that the prince was coming to town.
There was going to be a ball.
I do not know how the word got around.
But anyway he was supposedly looking for a wife.
Cinderella's fairy godmother managed to get a dress made up for her.
Because the other mother would not do anything or was not sposta let her go to the ball.
So she went to the ball.
Leaving the ball she tripped going down the stairs.
The prince found the shoe.
He came around to all the homes trying to find the person that the shoe fit.
Thus when it fit cinderella she became the queen or princess.
I want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Little girl had a cat.
She is riding her tricycle with a cat.
Dog came along.
The dog scared the cat.
The cat run.
He run up a tree to get away from the dog.
A good friendly neighbor decided he would take a ladder.
He gets up there.
So they call the fire department.
Because i tell this background setting in it.
Bebecause i was pretty proud the way it turned out.
It give me a lot of self confidence in myself.
I have based a lot of things decisions on that.
"Okay i worked for general mills, i told you."
I worked for.
When i hired in there i was a horse person.
I did not know anything about.
Studied electronics.
Pretty soon over the maintenance department i worked for.
They there is a lot of a lot of a hard concentration for this department this package maintenance department.
My boss had had two heart attacks.
He hadta retire.
They asked me to take his place.
I told ththem i would on one condition.
That i went on salary instead of being a union employee and hourly working.
I am not going to come in this plant like he did.
Him called in all times of night with problems.
Unless i get paid for it.
I just will not answer my phone.
So i they agreed to pay me time and a half for every everytime i come in there.
So and so my paperwork made it.
I got a good job and working.
Got the department straightened out.
Got things going good.
They general mills it when they opened up i was one of the first twenty seventh people that hired in there.
I end up when i was left i was the twelfth on the seniority list for the whole thing.
But what they did they give everybody some really tough exam questions.
When they got when a certain higher grade above that they quit using these.
I do not know whether the government made them or not to hire people.
They had ththem get take the test anyway.
They filed ththem.
But hired ththem whether they they passed the grades they thought should be or not.
Well i am department's going along pretty good.
I getting more and more.
We are getting bigger.
I hadta have more and more people.
Hadta train ththem.
But ordinarily hiring practice for the maintenance two of the maintenance departments was hadta have a certain score on their entrance exam is all it takes for to get bid into those two departments bebecause hadta learn a lot.
My mechanics had four years of training before they could even get their a rate.
So that went on and on for years.
Then they sent me word one day i was sposta be available for a meeting in the afternoon in a certain certain conference room.
He this guy said.
We you we can no longer allow you to pick and hire the people for your department.
He put on the board up there.
He says.
You got to pass the test here at this line.
You got this line drawn.
He said.
Here is all these guys make good mechanics?
He said.
You do not know if it makes a good mechanic.
You can no longer okay attest them hire they to to get in.
They done cannot in yours.
Well i could see the handwriting on the wall right there.
You know a guy cannot read and write.
How can you read blueprints?
How can you read a manual and stuff?
Right after the meeting he had sent word for me to come into his office.
I went to his office said.
We hafta do this.
Any kind of expense account you need.
I says.
I got to train these people?
I got a department to run.
I got to train ththem?
He says.
We will help you financial things.
So they sent us off.
I put the whole together.
I wrote the tests for us.
Got it all set up.
So it was time that we needed some employees in there.
Once before at a meeting all the supervisors or department heads on monday morning ten of the clock we had a meeting to talk about production.
How much you going to do?
What is going to finish of it future of it?
So in one one of them meetings they told me that you know says.
Discussed some of the women filed a a suit against general mills that worked there on on discriminating the labor that they they bebecause they was women they could not get some of the high paying jobs.
Somebody had brought that up.
They sort of told how it was turned out in court.
One of ththem looked at me.
Harold one of these days the women will bid into your department.
You will probably kick her out.
When you do you are fired.
Well after i put all these tested up.
They opened it up.
Hired opened up bids for four mechanics to come into my department.
Well when he come in there.
Brought it back to me the ones who win the bid.
One of ththem was a black guy named rodney.
I knew rodney from.
He would watch the machines.
He said.
Them brakes and how this spikes the box.
I was tickled to death he was in there bebecause he is anxious to learn about the machines.
Well hadta run the classroom.
They come in conference room every morning.
I got these books.
And they could sit there and study all joined together.
But they could get it on their own.
Whenever they felt like they ready to take a test on this certain part that they studying they come in.
I get ththem.
I take ththem private.
They would take a test.
Then i would tell ththem whether they got it wrong or if they got it right.
"If they got ththem all right or or passed it they go on to the , next set of books."
But they hadta had six months to finish the whole thing.
Rodney every time i would come into the conference room rodney would say.
"Harold harold, here read this to me."
I do not quite understand what it says.
I would read it.
I explained it.
Oh now i see it.
He would do it two or three times.
And then he would take the test.
I would go over the questions for him.
Pretty soon he is falling behind you know with them.
So union come to me and says.
Rodney wants to know if you will give him his tests verbally.
I says.
He said.
Said he took tests all the way through high school verbally.
I said.
He took algebra tests verbally?
There is something wrong there.
So i could the light up my head then see.
I said.
Then personnel sent for me to come up there.
Did you ever see rodney's entrance exam?
I says.
They show.
I said.
It are not got nothing on it.
Yeah he did not get nothing.
So i said.
Rodney has.
What is it start?
Everything when you read things they are backwards?
You know what i am talking about.
So i said.
Well hell you know he how can he in the middle of the night pull out a manual on the scene.
He cannot do it make it.
I am going to throw him out you know.
So the whole plant's a buzz you know.
What what what is harold going to do?
He is going to pull his weight.
So they sent back notice the union did that they was having a meeting with the personnel department.
Well i went up front.
In the argument i am right you know.
I am going to stick to my guns no matter what.
You know i am not prejudice about rodney nothing to do with that.
Everybody's going to get on me.
So we go in the room.
The personnel manager was hounded of all things black.
They had hired him at that and that.
So we come into that room.
There is a secretary there ready to take notes on this meeting.
So this black guy he laid back and said hello to everybody.
Everybody knew each other.
I never will forget it.
He says.
Harold may not walk on water.
But when it comes to his department he is god.
You better believe it.
If he says you will not make it in his department you are not going to make it.
He said.
Now rodney you could have two things choices.
If you volunteer right now to go back to your department you can have your job back that you had it before.
If harold sends you back you got to start at the bottom of the seniority list.
What are you want rodney?
Rodney says.
Oh i will go back.
I will go back on.
I will go get my job back.
He turned around and thanked me.
Harold shook my hand.
Thank you harold for all you did in trying to help me.
I walked right through that plant.
But i knew what they was thinking.
That i fired rodney.
I was fired too.
But it i stuck to my guns.
I knew it was right.
Now is that kind of thing you wanted?
It goes through the the window and breaks the window.
It is his dad sitting in the chair i believe.
The ball comes right in to him.
He gets up the ball and looks out the window.
He is trying to make up his mind whether he should punish the kid for it or not punish him.
Little boy's going outside.
And and his mother knows it is raining.
Mother offers him an umbrella.
He do not want to youse the umbrella.
He gets wet.
Starts getting wet.
He come back.
Made her do all the work.
The sisters did not hafta do nothing around the house.
Somehow she got invited to a party.
Frank i have forgotten what reason she got invited.
But she went away in a carriage.
I mice turned into the horses for it.
The pumpkin turned into a a carriage for ththem.
Off to to see the princess she went.
She was holding a beautiful gown and had beautiful glass slippers on.
She had a good time.
Hadta return back by midnight or the the carriage would turn to back to a pumpkin.
But on the way out of the place she lost one of her slippers glass slippers.
The prince rather found that.
He went around looking for the lady that had been to that party.
He got the slipper.
It fit her foot.
As much as i can remember.
Well i would take the bread and put the peanut butter on first.
That would be my way of making it.
No other than i i make sure that there is plenty of peanut butter on both sides of the bread.
Well the father had put a ladder up against the tree.
He climbed up to get get the daughter's cat down.
The cat had got out on a limb and was afraid to move.
The ladder evidently slipped and had fallen from the tree.
Daddy could not get down.
Evidently somebody had called the fire department to bring a ladder to get down and also to get the cat.
The ladder looked long enough to reach out the limb that they were sitting on.
Say probably the decision that i made to get out of education and to get into banking probably was the most because i had a wonderful career in banking.
I met a lot of people.
Prospered more too than i probably would had i stayed in education.
I teaching job at louisville.
It so happened that the year i moved back from georgia.
I i would i would lived in georgia one year.
"Had a contract to work for the schools at fort benning georgia, the army post."
I would decided to come back to kentucky.
I had a a contract to teach in louisville.
It so happened that that happened to be the year that general electric had built appliance park in louisville.
They had brought a lot of employees in looking for housing.
In addition to that the theological seminary down there had bought a lodge apartment.
And they had turned out the people in that so that their students would have a place to live.
Really to find a place to live was very very tough.
Obvious because the baby was born about a month after we moved back to kentucky.
When we would go to what few apartments were available they would say.
We do not take where you are going to have children.
I said.
Well i am going to go back to lexington.
My wife was kind of nervous for me giving up a job in louisville.
I went and i said.
I am going to find a job.
So when i got back that afternoon it was a wednesday.
We stayed at my parents' home.
I answered an ad in the paper for a young man for a financial institution herald leader box so and so.
I wrote it.
Friday i was called to come down on saturday.
In those days the banks stayed open on saturdays.
They offered me the job on on monday.
I went down to louisville.
I told ththem that i was not going to honor the contract.
That i had taken a job in lexington.
I told ththem why.
Well it did not particularly interest the principal because he here he was a month before school was starting and no teacher.
They exercised the.
It useta be the kentucky law if you broke a contract in one month or less prior to the start of school they took your your teaching certificate.
I had a master's and i had a master's certificate.
I had a permanent certificate.
I never did get the certificate back.
But it really did not matter because i found a job that i really loved.
From i never will forget i saw the principal at the state basketball tournament.
He said.
I had been suspended for a year.
I said.
No not really because i think i have got the job i really love.
I spent forty three years in that job.
And it came up the ladder all the way from assistant manager to of a small bank and to the president and the chairman of the board.
Actually happened though the man that i was assisting nervous breakdown.
Young man ended up in a institution.
I went into something.
Now what actually had happened when i was at university of kentucky my my electives i took in business courses.
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed commercial.
I took courses like economics and money and banking and that those type of courses as my electives.
So i had a pretty good background.
Plus the fact that i they sent me up to university of indiana to for three summers for special education in their graduate school.
Well you have a young man out in the yard practicing soccer.
He happens to kick it at at at his it could be his neighbor it could be his own home.
But i i would guess his neighbor's house.
He kicked it through the picture window.
The man inside was reading.
It not only broke the window it knocked over his lamp.
Then the ball landed in his lap.
At the end of this story the man is looking to see who did it.
I my guess is he he probably went outside to talk to the boy about the damage that had been done.
Well mother is sending out probably is a boy and and and tells him to take the umbrella with him.
You know i do not need the umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
Mother let him go out.
He got outside.
He got soaking wet and because it did rain.
He went back in to get the umbrella.
His mother mother gave him the umbrella.
Then used the umbrella it he was not doing much good bebecause he held it over his shoulder.
He was probably getting just as wet as he did without the umbrella.
Well i think so.
Well the only details i really know is that she happened to have a stepmother.
The stepmother had a girl that she was was promoting really for marriage i presume.
Stepdaughter was got no privileges at all through the stepmother.
There was a big party.
To tell you the truth i forget how she got to the dance.
But anyway she in her hurry she met prince charming.
And all of a sudden it got bidnight.
She hadta leave.
She left in a hurry.
She lost a shoe.
He picked up the shoe later.
He went all through the village.
And and i think the mother tried to get the shoe fit her daughter.
But it would not work.
So finally they cinderella he found cinderella.
They lived ever happy ever after.
She is reaching up trying to get her cat which climbed the tree.
In order to help her i took my ladder and climbed a tree.
But for some reason the ladder fell down.
Our puppy dog decided that was pretty funny.
He was barking at us.
My wife looked out the window.
She saw the predicament i was in.
So she called the local fire department.
They came out with their ladders.
The puppy dog enjoyed the whole thing.
Now i would go to the pantry.
The next thing i would go to the refrigerator where we keep the jelly.
Then i would go to the utensil drawer.
Then if i did not want to mess up the jelly i would get a spoon out of the utility utensil drawer.
I could use the same knife.
Then i would take and put the two pieces of bread together.
Once we had done that i would then take the knife.
Slice it into two pieces so we would have two sandwiches or one sandwich divided in two.
That would be how i would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Of course i would return the jelly to the refrigerator.
Where it could be washed at a later date.
Am i supposed.
My wife and i took off and and went to visit her sister in indianapolis indiana because it was her birthday.
We went up to visit.
We stayed with another sister up there.
We went out to dinner that evening.
The next day we had planned to stay all day long.
Which we had done often before.
About nine of the clock in the morning i got a telephone call from one of my sons here in town.
He gave us the news that our eldest son had died in his sleep.
So i got this in the one room.
I hadta walk in the other room and tell my wife.
I have never had a more difficult time in saying anything except to say that you know.
Our son gene died in his sleep.
So we threw our clothes in the car.
We took off for lexington.
We got here as rapidly as we could to come back down here to see what was going on.
"He had found out when he was in his late thirties, early forties that he was epileptic."
He was taking medicine.
Apparently he had had an epileptic seizure in his sleep.
He died.
A few days later you know three or four days later we had the funeral.
He is now buried at calvary cemetary here.
That is where we we talked earlier about taking the dog in the car and going to the cemetery rides like that where we do that.
Often throughout the week we go out.
But that happened in nineteen ninety one.
We still think about it obviously.
It is very traumatic situation to lose a child because in the general scheme of things it is been said that the parents oughta die before the children.
But that does not always happen.
That is probably what i can remember most now.
One very bright and clear day one of the children of this household decided he wanted to go out and kick a soccer ball.
So as he was kicking the ball he kicked it very hard.
It went through a nice plate glass window in the living room of his home.
A very surprised father looked up as the ball came through the window and landed in his lap or near his lap.
He picked it up.
Looked out to see what in the world had gone on.
He saw the young man out there which i am assuming was his son very upset about the fact that he had just kicked the soccer ball through the window.
That is all i can say.
This is a story about a little boy getting ready to go to school.
His mother wants him to take his umbrella because she has heard the weather report.
The weather report says.
Hey it is going to rain today.
But he does not want to do that.
So he gives it back to her.
He waves.
She looks at him saying to herself.
You know you really should be taking this umbrella.
But he does not want to take the umbrella.
But as he walks down the street on his way to school it starts to rain.
Ahhah mom knew a little bit more about it than he did.
So he hadta turn around.
His mom looking very stern at him because had he taken the umbrella when she gave it to him he would not be standing there sopping wet.
So the next picture and the last picture shows him walking down the street with the umbrella.
He apparently is a little happier now that he is got the umbrella because he is not getting as drenched as he would before when he did not have the umbrella.
Cinderella was a very young girl who was sent off to live with i do not know whether it was her aunt or something by her guardian.
Some of the first scenes it shows her being sent to visit or stay with this lady who has two daughters of her own.
Those two daughters of course are not very nice looking young ladies.
When they got there instead of being greeted as one member of the family she was treated as a servant.
Anytime they wanted something they would yell for cinderella.
Somewhere along the line the announcement came from the king's castle that they were going to have a very large party.
So he might find a bride because his mother was pushing pushing pushing to get him married.
So she decided even though he did not want it that she was going to have a big party for him.
But somewhere before this party he had gone downtown in disguise in this little town and was wandering around.
He accidentally met cinderella.
He thought.
"Well he hadta be herded back into his carriage and back to the thing because his guardians were watching over him, his guards."
But he never did forget this young lady.
But anyway they started with this big party.
We got a big party at the castle.
All the girls in the area were invited to come to the party.
The intent being that he might find his future bride from one of these girls.
They had sent around a courier to each household.
Anybody that had girls in the family or ladies to come to this party.
So he saw cinderella there.
He said.
Well she can come too.
But the stepmother says.
She she just works here.
She does not get to come.
Well anyway the time came for the party.
The other two girls got all dressed up and their mother in their best gear.
They went to the party.
But she said.
Well everybody's sposta go.
Her stepmother said.
No you are not going to go the party.
You are going to stay here and take care of house.
So she had some little mousy friends that liked to play around.
She would talk to them because she dudn't have anybody else to talk to.
So they decided that they were going to fix up a thing.
She was going to go to the party.
So what they did is they got some old material.
They made a dress for her.
They put this gown on her.
Then they got a pumpkin.
They her fairy godmother came to see her and said.
Well we are going to fix it up so you can go to the dance.
She said.
Do not have one way to get there.
She said.
We will take care of that.
So she took this pumpkin.
She tapped the pumpkin.
It turned into a glorious carriage.
She tapped on the mice.
They turned into beautiful white horses to draw the carriage.
I think one of the the older mice was to be the driver of the carriage.
So she put her in there.
They went to the carriage.
She had was all bedecked in very beautiful clothes.
She danced and danced.
The only thing the the was to happen was she was sposta leave at midnight because at midnight this would all disappear.
So her fairy godmother said.
You can stay there but you better be out of there by midnight because at midnight everything disappears.
So she went to the dance.
She danced with the prince.
He could not believe how pretty she was.
How she could dance and everything else.
He he thought in the back of his mind.
I have seen this young lady before somewhere.
I do not remember where it was.
But i have seen her.
Well it started the after the dance was going on the time drew night for her to go.
It got closer and closer to midnight.
So she said she hadta leave.
She hadta run.
She ran down the steps.
In the process she lost one of her slippers.
Which happened to be a glass slipper.
She jumped into the carriage.
They raced back.
Just about the time they got back to the house the time struck midnight.
The carriage disappeared and turned into a pumpkin.
She went on inside.
I do not know what happened to the dress.
I guess the dress turned into an old rag again that she would been wearing anyway.
She went on back in very happy that she had got an opportunity go to the ball.
The next day the prince sent his couriers out with this slipper to go to every household.
Find out who would fit that slipper.
So they were going around.
They came to this house.
Of course her stepmother invited them to come in and said.
You know here are my two daughters.
You should try them on them.
Well they could not get it on.
It would not go on their feet.
They pushed and tugged and did everything else.
And it would not work.
They looked around.
They saw cinderella.
They said.
She said.
They said.
The prince said every girl in this kingdom will try on that slipper.
So she sat down.
The slipper popped on to the amazement of the guards that had come and his people that were checking it out.
She was the one that the slipper would fit.
So they immediately went back to the prince and told him.
He came.
Later on they were married.
I would get out a loaf of bread.
Then i would go to the cupboard.
Get out a jar of jelly that is already been opened.
I would get a knife out of the drawer.
Well in the beginning a little girl who was riding her tricycle saw that a dog had chased her cat up a tree.
The little girl's father decided he would try to get the cat down.
He got out a ladder.
The dog is also barking at the bottom.
But in the meantime off on the other part of the tree sits a bird singing happily away away from the cat the dog and the father.
You may hafta stop me.
I would say a spending time as a peace corps volunteer when i was in my twenties.
But i went with my wife to liberia in west africa.
We both taught at a secondary school there.
I taught english.
She taught social studies.
I had the good fortune to work with some young men to develop a a basketball team.
But we went out to the forest.
Peace corps organized a high school basketball league.
The young men at the school woke me up every morning at five of the clock.
We went out and practiced from five thirty until six thirty or seven.
"But overall just the experience of living and working with liberians, teaching young people was a wonderful time."
He kicked it very hard.
Unfortunately it went through a neighbor's window.
The neighbor was sitting in his living room when the ball came through.
Not only broke the window but knocked over a a lamp on the table next to where the man was sitting.
The man got up.
Hadta decide where it came from.
What it was he was going to do about it.
The boy was going outside some place perhaps to school.
But in the first picture the mother is telling the little boy that he needs to take an umbrella because it is likely to rain.
He in the second picture he declines to take the umbrella says.
Well once he gets off partway to school it starts to rain.
Then it starts raining very hard in the next picture.
When he turns around and comes back he is soaking wet.
The mother has a scowl on her face scolding him for not having taken the umbrella.
But at that point he accepts her suggestion.
He goes back out carrying the umbrella with him trying to keep him dry wherever he is going.
Well a little bit i guess.
Well cinderella was stepchild of a woman who had two other girls.
In the same kingdom there was a prince who was unmarried.
The king thought the prince oughta get married and find a beautiful bride.
"So he decided to throw a big party, a ball."
Send out word throughout the kingdom that there would be this ball and a princess chosen for the prince.
"Well the two ugly stepsisters, unpleasant stepsisters decided they should go to the ball."
The stepmother dressed them and made sure that they looked properly.
They went off to the ball.
The cinderella who was the younger one wanted to go too.
But the stepmother said.
The sister said.
No she could not possibly be chosen.
They should not go in any case.
In the meantime cinderella found some things in a trunk i believe in the attic or something.
Her fairy godmother appeared and said.
Well of course she could go to the ball.
A turned a pumpkin into a carriage and some mice to horses.
Cinderella went off to the ball.
At the ball she was spotted by the prince who wanted to dance with her and because he thought she was the most attractive girl there.
She did dance with the prince.
But one of the things that the fairy godmother had told her was that she must be back by midnight or the or the coach would turn back to a pumpkin and and the horses to mice.
Her fancy dress would go back to her normal clothes.
So suddenly just as the clock began to strike twelve and she was dancing with the prince she remembered that.
By the time the prince got outside and looked around the there there was no coach with horses.
There was only some mice running around and so on.
The cinderella did get home.
The stepsisters got home telling all kinds of stories about the ball.
How they were probably going to be picked by the prince so on.
Cinderella just sort of listened.
Then the king sent out a decree that said that.
The most beautiful woman at the ball had run off suddenly.
The only thing left behind was a glass slipper.
The and that the prince would marry the girl that the slipper fit.
So they would go throughout the kingdom trying to find the girl that the slipper fit.
Eventually the prince i believe came to the home of the two stepsisters and mother and cinderella where he tried the on the slipper to the two sisters.
Which were sure it would fit them.
Of course it did not.
So the prince said.
Initially the the mother said.
The sisters said.
But cinderella appeared.
He said.
Well may i try the slipper on this daughter?
He did.
It fit.
She became the princess.
They all lived happily ever lafter.
Her father or someone came with a ladder to rescue the cat.
The dog is barking up the tree.
I get out a plate.
I would have a loaf of white bread.
I would spread the butter on the sandwich.
Then i would put peanut butter on that.
On top of that i would have jelly.
Well i think the most impressive trip that we took was in when we went to egypt.
We could see from a distance some fabulous weddings.
All their preparation that they were making.
A young boy is kicking a ball and crashed through a winda.
He looked up at the cracked window.
The mother is encouraging young child to take an umbrella.
The child seemed to sort of talk back.
It begins to rain.
The child does not have the umbrella.
Them gets home.
He is soaking wet.
The last picture shows the little boy with his umbrella going back out in the rain.
Well cinderella was cleaning the house.
The mother had a invitation for the daughters to go to this ball.
But it did not include cinderella.
She kept wishing she could go to the ball.
So she was looking in this trunk at pictures and dresses and things.
And somehow she wound up at the ball and had a great time dancing.
It fit cinderella.
The the sisters and all were making fun of her all the time.
I do not know how it finally ended.
Well i would get a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly.
A man took his daughter over into the park so she could ride her tricycle.
Also they took the dog and the cat along with them.
Well the cat climbed up in the tree.
The father of the girl climbed up the tree.
But he could not get to the cat.
So someone called the fire department.
They came running with a ladder that would be high enough to get to the cat.
So they got the cat down.
Everything worked out fine.
The bird was singing all this time.
I guess a most important event that i ever took on was i was working for a large property and casualty insurance company as a special agent.
We had agents all over the state.
I worked in oklahoma and in kentucky.
My job was to help these agents call on customers for the purpose of trying just to get permission to present a proposal for their insurance.
I did this for oh about eight or ten years.
Then it dawned on me one day.
The agents that i were working with and helping all had big fine cars nice homes and belonged to country club.
Wasn't enough salary to live a a life that my agents were living.
So then i decided i am going to try to make it as an agent where the money is.
So i went from a job at the insurance company which provided me with a company car hospitalization and all kinds of perks.
Took me about five years to where i was doing okay.
After about ten years i had a nice house two nice cars and belonged to a country club.
This boy was kicking a soccer ball around out in his yard.
He made one particularly hard kick.
Hit the man that was inside the house sitting in a chair right by the winda.
So he picked up the soccer ball.
Know what he did from that point on.
But and i guess he settled it with the family of the boy.
Little boy was getting ready to go to school.
His mother said.
You better take this umbrella.
He said.
Nah not going to rain.
I do not need that umbrella.
I do not want to be bothered with it.
Not much more than got out the the door out to the street when it started raining.
First it just started to sprinkle.
Then it started pouring rain.
So he turned around.
Went back in the house soaking wet.
His mother looked at hi am.
Well i tried to getcha to take the umbrella.
So anyway he changed his into dry clothes.
This family brought her into their home to raise her when she was about seven or eight years old.
They provided a place for her to stay.
They gave her a hard time.
Made her do all the dirty work around the house and such.
The cinderalla slept in the attic upstairs.
But she had the view out her window of the castle where the royal family lived.
Thought it would be nice if someday she could go and visit in that catta.
So anyway years went by.
The family had received an invitation from the castle to a dance.
Pretended like she was going to go to the dance too.
But the two daughters when they saw her with that dress they made her take it off.
Then they all left for the castle and the dance.
Meanwhile cinderella goes out in the garden in the backyard.
Sitting on a bench back there was all of a sudden appeared her fairy godmother.
Cinderella went over to her.
Her desire to attend the ball at the castle.
Well we can do that.
I am going to furnish you with a coach and horses to pull it.
The only thing is you have got to be out of that castle and back here by twelve of the clock.
I am going to see that you have a real nice dress and glass slippers and everything.
So cinderella went up.
There was the coach.
Which was made out of a pumpkin and i believe four horses to pull the the coach.
Well she got in the coach.
Driver of the coach took her up to the castle.
She got out and went in.
So anyway when the prince who lived in the castle saw her he was really taken with her.
He just danced with her the whole evening.
Cinderella was having such a great time that she kind of lost track of the time.
But then she looked up.
All of a sudden she realized that she had about two or three minutes before everything all her clothes and her pumpkin coach and everything was going to disappear disappear.
So she took off running out of the castle.
She was in such a hurry she lost one of the glass slippers.
But she got to the coach.
It took her back to where she was living.
The prince was kind of upset that he did not have time to get her name or address telephone number or anything.
So he he decided that.
The only way i am really going to find cinderella is to go from house to house and take this glass slipper that she lost.
Whoever this flipper fits that will be cinderella.
So he went to several houses.
Course all the the mean sisters wanted to try it.
So then he looked over and saw cinderella and all her shabby clothes and all.
Will not you come over and let me see if it will fit you?
So cinderella came over.
So he took her away and and married her.
They lived happily ever after.
You want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
You get the peanut butter from everwhat place it is stored.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
The dog chased the little girl's cat up the tree.
The father climbs the tree with the ladder.
While he is in the tree the ladder slips and falls.
Someone called the fire department to come and rescue the man.
I loved to fly.
The base operations officer called me.
Asked me would i like to fly in the t thirty three.
We took off.
We went up.
The pilot said.
We are going to go into a dive.
We will pull out at about three thousand feet.
When we pulled out apparently the helmet they had given me was a little large bebecause the helmet kept coming down and i was going up.
Since then i have flown in several jets.
He kicks it a little too hard not knowing which way it is going.
It hits the window.
Startles the man sitting in the living room.
The man looks out the living room and spots nothing while he is holding the ball.
A little boy is getting ready to leave.
His mother insisted that he take an umbrella.
Little boy says.
Mother i do not need an umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
He gets outside.
It starts raining.
He hurries back home.
She gives him an umbrella and apparently dry clothes.
He leaves this time with the umbrella covering him completely.
I suppose.
I do not.
There was this family that lived in never neverland.
A family had three daughters.
The she would look out and see the palace far in the distance.
Wonder what was going on in the palace.
The king who lived in the palace who had a son had was going to have a ball.
He sent an invitation to the family that their three daughters should come to the ball.
The mother however preferred two of the daughters.
Cinderella was left without a suitable attire.
Her fairy godmother came.
She attended the ball.
She was running out.
The clock struck midnight.
She turned back into the ordinary person.
But she lost a glass slipper.
The prince found the glass slipper.
She tried it.
He tried it on to her two sister's feet first.
It did not fit.
They tried it on cinderella.
The prince took crinderella to the palace.
They were married and lived happily ever after.
I would take a loaf of bread.
From it i would take two slices of bread.
Which i put on the kitchen table.
I would take a jar of peanut butter.
I would get a knife.
I would scoop a little section.
I would lathah the one side.
I might put some jam on it as well bebecause i like jam with my peanut buttuh.
I would put the other slice on top of it.
Then i would cut it in half.
I like like it warm.
Then i would eat it.
Oh i forgot i would put it on a plate.
I have a little napkin on the side.
If there is such a thing as absolute pandemonium this is it.
In the middle we have got papa up the tree apparently trying to reach a cat that has as cats will do gone up.
So papa are not going to be able to get out there.
But he apparently is trying.
Under the cat hoping to catch it is a little girl.
She is got her tricycle.
She is holding her hands up.
She wants her cat down safely.
He is barking just to add to all the other things that is going on.
There is a firetruck two firemen with hats and ladder.
They are coming to the rescue.
The question is how do we keep the cat from getting back up there?
Had a lot of things happen to me in my life.
I i am trying to think of some that might of had had a nice twist to it.
I i controlled the i oversight of the movement of munitions throughout the country.
I got to see it.
I know vietnam very well.
I traveled it.
I came back.
I was signed to the joint staff for the jcs.
There i had an opportunity to to participate in the development of the air campaign plan against north vietnam.
What we did was we took the country.
Then we made a little folder like this.
He would take this little folder over to linden johnson.
Johnson would approve every target that we fired at.
The first thing he looked at was how many civilian casualties.
He had a lot of social conscience.
If he felt as though there were excessive civilian casualties he would not let us hit targets.
For instance we never bombed havoy hanoi.
We never mined the haiphong harbor.
Militarily we should have.
Bebecause that is where the ships were coming in from russia other countries.
Bringing in munitions that were being used.
But you asked me about the main event in my life.
I came back from world war two.
I applied and was accepted at the university of virginia.
They do not care if you come to class.
They treat you like a man immediately.
I was enjoying a lovely time.
I was just having a good time going to university of virginia.
One day i got a call to go over to to dean lewis' office.
Dean lewis had pure white hair.
I went into his office.
He said.
He said.
I have noticed here that you are not doing well in your classes.
Let me tell you selfrighteousness will get you in trouble.
Well nobody told me.
Then dean lewis said.
Mister carter you least of all should hafta be told that you are doing sadly or badly in your classes.
If you do not improve you will not be with us next semester.
I went to work.
In fact he playing soccer.
Then he out does himself.
Guess where it ends?
Coming through and crashing through the window it lands in guess who?
But papa picks up the soccer ball.
Well i probably did my this myself one time.
What do i do about it?
I want him to be a man.
I want him to to be a child.
Little johnny is apparently heading to school.
Mama is saying.
Johnny do not forget your umbrella.
Johnny says.
I do not want to take an umbrella.
Old boys do not take boys do not carry umbrellas.
I do not want to look like i am not like the other boys.
She says.
He gets about fifty yards from home.
The sky opens.
The deluge starts.
So he turns.
He runs back home through the water.
Mama looks at him.
I told you so.
He says.
This time with his umbrella protecting him from rain.
I am running out.
You cannot help not liking cinderella.
Applaud the the good things that happen for her.
She apparently is adopted.
Their mother and the cat who is equally sharing dislike that one acquires of of the mother and the two spoiled daughters.
But the the scene opens with mama and the two daughters castigating cinderella.
Treating her like a adopted child.
There the king and his staff are working out the details of a a party that they are going to have.
They they send an invitation.
Which comes to the mother of this family.
Meanwhile cinderella is not asked to go.
There is a sad scene of her looking out the the window at the palace.
Then there is justice in the world.
But more important she makes possible all manner of good things.
So cinderella dons these.
There she has a wonderful time.
But the godmother tells her.
You must be gone.
You must leave before midnight.
Or the carriage which i made out of a pumpkin's going to become a pumpkin again.
Well as luck would have it cinderella was having a wonderful dance with the young prince who is tall and handsome.
It gets very near midnight.
At a certain point cinderella rushes out before the coach turns to a pumpkin again.
In doing it she loses her glass slipper.
Then she goes home.
There it happens that the prince found the glass slipper.
Is interested in finding out to whom it belongs because he sees her as someone he has fallen in love with.
He begins to search.
One of the king's staff arrives at home.
Each of the two daughters of the mother proceed to try to put their foot into it.
She tries it on.
It fits perfectly.
The story ends with her having returned to be with the prince and to enjoy the life there.
As opposed to being the the scrub maid for this family and and the two sisters and the cat.
When i was in my thirties there was a special program that was set up for people to get a master's degree in social work parttime.
That was something that was not ever done before.
A huge number of people applied to that program.
I got into it.
A boy goes out to to practice soccer.
He kicks the ball into the neighbor's window.
Luckily he does not hit the neighbor who gets up and goes to the window to either scold or return the ball.
This is probably a story with a moral that we do not necessarily agree with.
Mother tells her child that it is going to be rainy out.
He refuses.
Hasta go home and get the umbrella.
Which is sposta prove to him that mother always knows what is what is best.
You could possibly infer that this girl threw this cat up into the tree but i do not think she did.
Cat got up in the tree.
Father climbed up the tree.
The ladder fell down.
He did not have enough sense to tell the little girl to put the ladder against the tree.
So they hadta call the fire department to come and get the father and the cat.
She is having hysterics over there.
Okay i would say this could clearly be a katrina story.
"Okay there in the palace there is a queen and i two or three daughters and cinderella who is the stepsister, who is the cleanup person, and the maid, and the servant."
They get invited to a ball.
"Cinderella then is is at home cleaning, mopping, scrubbing, doing all the dirty work while the sisters are getting all dressed up to go to the ball."
"Cinderella goes to the ball , loses a slipper at the ball , runs home."
The prince who has been enraptured by her comes looking for the person whose foot fits the shoe.
She goes off and marries the prince.
First i would go to the store and buy the bread and buy the peanut butter and buy the jelly.
I would bring it home.
Well i guess the thing that always stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident.
And i remember asking the question.
But i needed an answer to it.
They said on the the other side of the phone they did not know.
I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and and getting out there.
I remember hearing the sirens approaching.
When i got there you know he had already been out.
He did not know who i was.
He did not know who anyone was.
But luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him.
So they knew that he was not drunk.
They knew that he was not impaired in any other way.
He knew enough to know that he had a stroke.
I remember he was the one who said to me.
Where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to.
I remember this police officer.
Luckily this police officer was someone who knew anthony and was with him when anthony was on the force.
So he came in younger guy when anthony w lieutenant.
So you know i remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you know in that it was very much movie or you know.
But and i remember getting down brain attack center.
Everybody was doing what they needed to do.
It was all this kind of prescribed dance that went on.
You know getting him there and and getting him that shot and and that starting.
And you know and then from there it was just the recovery.
But i do remember that.
That stays with me.
"Yeah it does, absolutely."
He is playing looks like soccer.
So he is kicking the ball.
Lo and behold it goes into the neighbor's or his own window and crashes through that window.
There is the the man who is sitting and either watching t v or talking or having a conversation.
"The soccer ball comes through the window, hits the lamp."
He then has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man.
The mother is saying to him.
Take this umbrella because i think it is going to rain.
He is saying.
"No, no, no, i do not need that umbrella."
I am leaving.
So she is got the umbrella in hand.
Then lo and behold the rain starts.
He is caught in the rain.
He makes his way home.
His mother is looking at him saying.
I told you so.
Let us get the umbrella.
Then you can go back out.
She saw her cat up in the tree.
She could have called her dad.
Her dad said.
Okay i am going to help you and go get the cat.
It does not seem like the ladder is quite as as high as what he needed to.
Then it looks like he used the ladder.
The ladder has fallen.
The dog is barking because they are all up in the tree.
The firemen hafta come and rescue.
"When cinderella was a little girl, she was brought to a house."
There was a stepmother.
The stepmother had two daughters.
The father dies.
The stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her two daughters and relegates poor cinderella to being a scullery maid so to speak.
So cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and and all of that.
Then the the the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes.
The mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of cinderella.
Then comes the the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity re to be a dance.
Everybody you know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the the perfect outfit.
And cinderella is not going to go to the ball.
I think cinderella finds a dress or something in the hope chest or what i would call now a hope chest.
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing.
So the sisters go to the ball.
"And the fairy godmother makes her first appearance, i believe."
So the fairy godmother creates the the carriage to take her in.
And her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball.
So when when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there.
She takes their breath away.
She meets the prince.
They dance.
They have a wonderful time.
But what happens is the clock strikes twelve.
She needs to be home.
She is running out the door.
Her shoe is left behind.
So she goes home.
The sisters and whatnot they all go home.
He combs through the village.
The stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers.
It does not work.
Then lo and behold he finds cinderella.
The shoe fits.
They get married.
They live happily ever after.
Way too many girls are looking for prince charming.
I would get the bread.
First well i would get the bread out of the.
For me i keep my bread in the freezer.
So i would take it out of the freezer and let it defrost.
My peanut butter stays in a cabinet.
So the bread comes out first.
The peanut butter and then the jelly comes out.
Once the bread is defrosted i will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first.
There you go.
We went to a place in long branch.
It was this sort of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families would get a room.
Then you would get a parcel kitchen.
And you know when you think about it now.
But and so we would go.
My folks never had much money.
And so they would sort of save up for this week.
And we we would all stay in this one room.
I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother.
And we would go to the beach.
We would just have a great time.
So i remember going to the pool.
They would have salt water pool.
I remember it being really cold.
So you would jump in in the morning.
You know you would just spend your whole day there.
You would be spent by the end of the day.
And i still remember the smells and the sights of it so.
You know and i remember the the routines.
There was a place called rutt's hut which i think is still around.
And but we would all get out there.
And so it became a a sort of a ritual that we all did together.
With two pieces of bread i would get a plate to put the bread on.
No i would not get a spoon.
I would use the same knife.
So i unscrew the top take the peanut butter with my knife and spread it on the bread.
Put the other slice of bread on it probably press it down a little bit and then slice it.
I guess the most important thing i can remember is when my children were born.
"That was the best day of my life on both occasions, like giving birth and and holding them in my arms and and what a miracle it was, you know."
I do not think there is anything that comes close to that out of everything i have ever done.
The day i got married.
You know different events that were were important you know.
But i guess the the most important ones were the days i gave birth.
Those i had a son and a daughter first and then a son two years later.
Well the little boy's having fun kicking his soccer ball.
Finally he is walking down the street.
He kicks it too hard.
It goes into the window.
The man is startled when the ball comes flying through.
Eventually the male man's got the soccer ball looking for the the little boy that that broke the glass out the window.
I do not know if he is a relative or he knows him even.
Looks like the the mom is trying to give the little boy an umbrella.
But i think he decides he does not need it and goes outside.
It starts to rain.
He comes back soaking wet.
I told you you needed the umbrella.
Then he leaves with the umbrella.
"The he is he is he is walking in the puddles, too."
That is something i would do.
A man went to help get the cat out of the tree.
Finally the firetruck is coming.
The firemen are coming with the fire fire ladder to get the both of them out of the tree.
It looks like the bird's laughing at both of them.
It wants the cat to jump in her arms.
They do not want to jump down.
Well cinderella's father gets married to a woman who has two daughters.
And then her father dies.
But makes her do all the housework and clean and act act like a servant maid in the house.
Cinderella befriends all the animals.
The birds love her.
The all the animals love cinderella.
The king wants the son to get married and has a ball.
Everyone is invited.
All the young women in the country are invited to go.
The stepmother finds out that cinderella was planning on going too.
They all destroy her dress.
And they told her she could not go.
I in the movie they i know they lock her in the room.
"But her fairy godmother comes and makes her the most gorgeous gown and makes her look so beautiful, and glass slippers."
She goes to the ball.
The prince falls in love with her.
But she hadta be back by the stroke of midnight.
As she realizes that the tower clock is chiming that she hasta leave and get back before she turns back to her old rag rag clothes.
She loses her slipper on the way.
The prince finds it and sends his his servants out to find out where she is who who wear wore that slipper.
They finally find cinderella.
They live happily ever after.
I would take actually i would take two slices of bread.
I would smear peanut butter on the one slice and jelly on half.
Every president's day week we useta take the auto train down to florida for that week and meet my parents down by disney world and go to disney world.
The one time we got on the train my husband worked for the train.
There was a deadhead.
Deadhead means when they are towing the a part of a train back to where it needs to be.
It was going down to florida.
Well we picked it up in dc.
So we went all the way to florida in that one.
So we ended up being able to use the presidential car.
"We each had our own bed, our own bathroom."
How i guess the the rich and famous travel like that.
But i said to my kids.
"Enjoy it now bebecause we are never probably going to ever do this again, you know."
To lay in bed and watch as you are looking out the window at the scenery going by.
We had two pillows each you know.
"And we went to disney world, too."
That was one thing that i do remember.
That was fun a really fun time that we had on the train.
Well there is this little boy who is outside with a soccer ball.
He is kicking it around.
He is kicking it around.
All of a sudden he kicks it a little too hard.
"It goes into the window where it comes, almost on the lap of the man sitting in his chair."
"It startles him, gets him scared."
He gets up.
He is looking out the window for that little boy.
I am sure that little boy took off.
You know but he he is looking out the window for him.
Well there is this little boy again and his mom.
His mom says.
You know it looks like it is going to rain.
You better take the umbrella.
He says.
Mom i do not need the umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
I am not going to need it.
He leaves to go.
All of a sudden it starts raining.
"It starts raining, raining!"
He gets drenched.
He hasta turn around and go back and tell his mom.
It is raining.
I need the umbrella.
He gets the umbrella and goes off to school.
That is moms always know!
Well it looks like there was a cat that was being chased by a dog up the tree.
She is she wants her cat to get down from the tree.
"So, i imagine it is her father that decides to climb up the tree."
But he gets stuck up the tree.
He cannot get down.
Finally somebody called the fire department to come rescue all of them.
They the father and the cat were stuck up the tree.
So they the fire department came through again.
Her mother dies.
Her father remarries.
The woman he marries has two daughters.
"Who the the stepmother thinks her daughters are beautiful, magnificent and does not want cinderella to get any anything once the father passes away."
Makes cinderella do all the work.
Her she wants cinderella to be her servant and and clean the house.
There is this handsome prince that lives in town.
"The prince's father, the king, decides it is time for his daughter to get married and meet someone."
"He sends a notice out to everyone in town, all the women that are eligible to dress up and come to this ball."
Cinderella wants to go.
The she gets her dress.
"I think it was her mother's dress, if i remember correctly."
She is going to wear that.
The sisters find her trying it on.
They they rip it on her and make a mess of the dress.
So she cannot go to the ball in that dress.
Off the the the stepsisters go to the ball.
The fairy godmother comes and helps cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up.
She looked just gorgeous.
The prince falls in love.
The only one thing was that she hadta be leave the ball by twelve of the clock on the strike of twelve.
She hadta get out of there or she was going to turn back into her rag clothes again.
So she was having a wonderful time.
She hasta leave the ball clock starts striking twelve.
She loses one of her glass slippers.
The prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this glass slipper.
Finally they they they were not going to try cinderella bebecause she they nobody thought she was at the ball.
But they finally try her foot in the slipper.
It fits perfectly.
She turns back into this gorgeous gown and clothing again.
And the prince marries her.
They live happily ever after.
To make a sandwich if i am going to make a whole sandwich i would use two pieces of bread.
"Cut it in half or fours, whatever way you like it."
When my daughter was born.
You know that old song what a difference a day makes?
I mean from the pregnancy which was just wonderful.
I ate everything i wanted.
I felt terrific.
I was working full time.
My freezer looked like an oreida convention.
"I could eat my you know my crinkle cuts, my shoe strings, with pasta."
I could do anything.
I looked like meatloaf by the time i got to the hospital i hafta say.
"My my my obstetrician you know during the the buildup to this would say, you will be sorry!"
I said you know i cannot imagine regretting this.
So then i get to the hospital.
It was probably the worst experience i ever had.
I was told that if i had automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward.
That is what i was told.
It did spark revenge in me that i actually carried out.
You know my my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook.
He said.
Well we are just going to break your water.
It will move things along.
I said.
I can do this myself you know.
Then he kept saying.
I do not understand while you are not relaxed.
"Every time he said relax, i became even more infuriated."
You know this is the effect it had on me.
He was not listening when i said stop saying that.
"When you tell some one to stop doing x, you expect them to stop doing that."
"She was born smiling, right away recognized my voice."
So now i went for my first postpartum checkup.
I am sitting on the table.
He you know does the finger pricks and to get some blood out.
He turns around.
He puts the little tube in the machine.
Then he turns it on.
The machine is whirring.
I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock.
It happened really fast.
I threw him on to the table.
"Then i jumped on top of him, put my knee in his groin."
He his tie was crooked.
I said.
I do not understand why you are not relaxed!
What is the matter you know.
Although you know it was all in good fun because later on you know he.
They had a nurse too.
They said.
Selfishly linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives.
"That was a big big experience, you know pee wee's big adventure."
Well it seems there is a boy out playing.
"Unfortunately it goes right into the window, breaks it."
I am going to guess that is his father sitting there.
Now he gets the ball.
He is surveying the damage and his son i guess.
It does not does not look like it is going to end too too well.
Okay well here is this little child leaving for school.
Mother saying.
Child says.
No no i do not need an umbrella.
I do the same thing.
Now it is raining.
Now it is pouring.
Then the child comes home you know obviously soaking wet.
The mother is kind of in her i told you so mode.
Boy he learned a lesson.
"Life is learning, from one's mistakes."
They get stuck in trees i guess.
I have i have heard stories like that.
I guess it is the the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like she is ready to catch the cat.
The little dog of course wants the cat down for different reasons.
Then the fire department shows up.
They got the ladder.
So cinderella is sent to live with a family.
She is very you know sweet and helpful.
These two are kind of spoiled and you know not very pleasant.
There is going to be a ball.
I i believe invitations go out.
They are going to go to the ball.
Cinderella is not invited.
Somehow the fairy godmother steps in.
Cinderella ends up with.
"Well it is all magical, you know right."
The pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach.
By dint of you know luck and good favor from the fairy godmother cinderella does go to the ball.
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight.
So she is dancing with the prince having a wonderful time.
I could have told you that from the beginning you know.
But anyhow cinderella finds out what time it is.
She needs to leave you know to get into the the the carriage to go back before midnight.
She her slipper fill slips off when she is running down the steps.
The prince finds it.
Then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that you know he wants to find this this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper.
I remember the details now from my own picture book.
When when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet.
So anyway they locked cinderella up.
I think nobody wanted them to find her.
The mice helped.
They brought the key.
She you know the animals loved her.
Of course it all ends happily ever after.
It is discovered that the slipper fits her.
She lives happily ever after with the handsome prince.
Just the way we all live.
You know you know really it was like they knew me.
Alright well first of all i would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture.
Now when i make a sandwich.
I i like to make sure when i put the slices out that the contours are going to match up you know?
It is got to be just right.
So anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter.
"Again two slices of bread is nice, but for this we will put the peanut butter on first with a knife."
Then i usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so i can spread it around.
It it just works better than with the knife.
"You know in this case you could cut it in half, fold it in half, get another piece."
You know if i had two pieces i would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle you know like that.
I like a good smd.
I guess a lot of important things sort of happened you know?
For instance i grew up in a family.
Now i do not want this to sound you know politically incorrect but my father was italian of italian descent.
He had this mind set that girls just do not go to college.
Can you imagine?
So anyhow it was made very clear that college was not on the map.
I have been supporting you all these years.
Now you owe me.
You know you hafta go to work and contribute to the household.
At the time i was not realizing how grave it was.
In fact there was something that felt almost exciting about it.
That i will be going to work soon you know.
I got to high school at twelve.
Now i was going to work.
So my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal i think when she heard i was not going to college because i was an honor student.
She actually wanted to call him.
I said.
There is really no point.
You know it is you are not going to get anywhere.
So anyway she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on wall street and who worked at a personnel department at what was then the irving trust company which no longer exists.
They took great pride in that that company.
They considered themselves at the top of wall street.
This was verbalized.
So anyway she called her friend.
I will never forget her.
Her name was firstname lastname who i went to see.
So i i put a suit on went shopping and bought myself you know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview.
I think i was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her.
So she hired me.
I ended up in a subbasement.
I think i was lower than the vaults.
I could be a genius but i was going to the secretarial pool.
I did.
I took typing and stenography.
I thought this might help me.
I have at least a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever i end up you know.
So i end up in a secretarial pool.
"The irving, as they call themselves, were a very conservative organization."
I i i preface that because they did not tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there is a fee involved.
So if somebody you know in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches you know where i was.
So i got there on monday and by wednesday a call came in.
It was sort of like i could imagine being at any orphanage where a call comes in.
They pick you.
They needed a fillin.
So they selected me.
Up i went.
I walked in.
You could hear a pin drop in this place.
You you know it it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water.
You should genuflect you know to sit down at your desk.
You know my skills were good.
I am answering the phone.
"I am taking shorthand, letters."
Things are humming along.
It turns out that she the secretary whom i was replacing was not coming back.
She was pregnant and was having some difficulties some complications so the the absence was going to be long term.
They hired me.
I had a raise right away.
I thought this work life is a cinch.
I am here for a week and i got a raise.
I got out of the subbasement you know.
You know moving along so quickly that i i figured i was going to have some meteoric rise down on wall street you know.
So one day for about three months i guess.
I was out to lunch still trying to you know explore the area.
"It is a very exciting place, you know."
I found the new york stock exchange.
I you know i was sort of like a pseudo tourist.
So i was walking up broadway one day.
"I encounter the marine midland bank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge, went up a few stories."
I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the irving.
"You know it was a great place, light and airy, modern."
I went in.
I asked the security guard where the personnel department was.
So i was directed there.
I sat down filled out an application.
I was drunk with power by then you know because i had gotten the raise.
Things were moving so quickly.
So i filled out the application.
The interview with the personnel manager went very well.
She told me about three different types of positions i could have.
I could pick whichever one i wanted.
So i picked the one in the international department.
That sounded really interesting to me.
We covered peru mexico equador bolivia and chile.
We we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the latin american area.
My direct boss he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the paris office.
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor.
"So of course, you know how romance always wins out."
I had a boyfriend.
I did not want to move to paris.
Many people probably would have said paris you know.
I probably made the wrong choice bebecause the romance did not work out either.
So i decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because i i knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a little more fast moving and exciting.
I i figured this is a good you know juncture to get out of banking.
It seemed very staid no matter where you were.
So i i i got a an agent.
I had you know kind of felt my way around you know how things work down on the street by then.
Then i ended up working for some brokerage firms.
Then i i i i had my daughter.
So i applied to montclair state.
And i was accepted.
I came in at the time was a second career program.
The important thing was that i did it.
I got my degree.
I graduated summa cum laude.
I had marvelous experiences.
I realized that i could still kind of live the life i might have.
When i mention a day student it is because i was always among young mainstream students.
I thought.
Gee maybe i will be sort of ostracized from main society here.
They liked me.
I liked them so it was a wonderful experience.
So i got the degree anyway.
Yeah this is that same disaster that we had last week.
The boy is outside having fun you know kicking around the soccer ball.
It goes right through the window.
"Knocks the lamp over too, i see."
The father happened to be sitting in the chair.
He gets up.
He is got the ball in his hand.
He looks out the window.
Seems like the boy is going to have a bad evening.
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that.
Funny he was just sitting there.
You do not even see a newspaper or something you know.
He was just sitting there waiting for disaster to strike.
Well we have what looks to be a mother and her child.
But in other pictures i do not know.
I think it is a little boy.
The mother is telling the child to take the umbrella.
Child says no.
You know that that whole idea is rejected.
Mother offers the umbrella again.
Uhoh outside started to rain.
Now it is pouring.
Child comes in soaked.
The mother is standing there with that you know i told you so attitude and and kind of annoyed i guess.
But that is what mothers do you know.
You want to protect your child.
They do not like the idea.
They think you are mean and difficult.
You just do not want your child to fall down and skin their knee.
You do not want them to get wet.
You do not want anything to happen to this child.
I know that is how i was.
Or later maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella.
You know so maybe a lesson learned for the future.
That maybe mommy you know is not that bad after all.
Well for reasons that were not entirely clear to me cinderella ends up being a maid working for this family.
I mean cinderella was so nice even the barnyard you know animals loved her.
Mice even you know.
Anyway an an announcement comes to the unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their their their mcmansion where they live.
They got an invitation to to a ball.
The prince was going to give a ball.
Cinderella useta she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance.
So when news came of this ball she was also silently very excited about it.
But the two girls you know of course they were going.
They had an invitation.
Somehow i forget some of the details in between.
"But there was a fairy godmother who ends up you know helping, working some magic."
Cinderella does go to the ball.
A pumpkin that that that that gets turned into a a a carriage and with horses.
She is got a beautiful gown on.
She just looks really just beautiful.
She the prince of course you know sees her right away.
You know one of those across the crowded room.
They danced all night.
You could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the that or whoever they were.
The wicked stepsisters i do not know.
You see the the the clock is is striking twelve.
She is saying goodbye to the prince.
Of course he does not want to let her to leave.
She is running down this you know a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe.
The butler or whoever majordomo from the the palace was sent around you know to the town to find who fits into the shoe.
Cinderella gets locked up.
You know that horrible mother thought that you know they would cram the shoe on one of her daughters' feet.
I remember their feet were ugly too.
The mice end up getting.
Oh she was locked in this room you know.
They did not want her on the scene.
The mice brought her the key.
She got out and tried on the shoe.
Of course it fit perfectly.
She married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after.
One hopes.
I hope they were not the bridesmaids at the wedding those those horrible people.
"Now, i really wish they had two pieces of bread here."
"They do not call it a sandwich, right."
We will we are pretend we have two pieces of bread.
I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread.
Then the peanut butter i put on with a knife on each piece of bread.
If i had two i would put the peanut butter on both.
Then i like to use a teaspoon for the jelly.
Bebecause i love smdz.
But i do not like a bite of the crust first.
Hasta be a particular way you know.
There are several.
Let me think what would be a good story.
Well very recently two thousand six my husband and i decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country.
Since we did not have complete leisure time we divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every stadium in the country.
In two thousand twelve we completed that.
We have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in in thirty cities.
Then of course they went ahead and built a new stadium in miami.
So on memorial day weekend we flew down to miami for a day to see a baseball game there.
In august we will be driving out to minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there.
So when we hear if you build it they will come we think it is meant for us and that we are going to go see baseball games.
"Even though i had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally, these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had."
It was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that we would never seen or never would have seen.
We love to talk about it.
Okay there is a young boy kicking a soccer ball.
He does not know his own strength so he kicks it very far and very hard.
It breaks the window.
The gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball.
Then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked.
He is holding the ball.
He is looking out the window to see who kicked the ball.
Okay cinderella is a story about a little girl who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled.
She is not treated as an equal.
She is treated as a real stepchild.
She gets the name cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders out of the fire.
She grows up in that role where her her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not.
The king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry.
The invitation comes.
Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball.
Her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball.
Cinderella thinks she will not go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball.
Noone knows who she is.
She has her glass slippers.
She gets into the pumpkin that is turned into the carriage.
She rides to the ball.
But she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight.
So she goes to the ball.
She has a wonderful time.
The clock strikes twelve.
She is running out of the ballroom.
She loses a glass slipper.
"The prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry, he is going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his his true love."
He comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live.
The two two stepsisters try on the slipper.
Of course it does not fit.
Just as he is going to give cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him.
But the slipper does not break.
She tries on the slipper.
It fits.
They live happily ever after.
That is about as concise as i could make the story of cinderella.
I would take a knife.
I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly.
Since there is only one piece of bread i would spread the peanut butter first.
Then i would spread the jelly.
Then i would fold the bread in half.
Yes it is something i love talking about.
My husband and i set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park in the country of of which there are thirty.
We started in two thousand six and we finished last year.
When we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something.
We were also very sad that it was finished.
"But every time they build a new ball park, we will be going."
So and and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling.
We made the sentiment of the card correspond with with the the trip itself.
The first one it said.
It in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen.
We saw cities we never would have seen.
We interfaced with people that we never would have you know communicated with bebecause they are very different when you leave the new york area.
Even though they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family.
In fact her name cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders.
She is kept down at heel even though they are wealthy and snobby.
An invitation comes to a ball.
The the stepsisters are very excited as is cinderella about going.
But it is quite clear that she will not be going to the ball.
Cinderella's friends from the field make her a dress.
She is all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say.
You are not going.
They destroy the dress.
She is devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball.
Suddenly her fairy godmother appears.
Her fairy godmother gives her a dress.
She turns a pumpkin into a carriage.
She turns four white mice into four horses.
I could sing it but i will not.
The only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken.
Everything will turn back to the way it is.
She goes to the ball.
She meets the prince.
She dances with the prince.
They are falling in love.
The clock strikes twelve.
So she hurries out.
In her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her.
The prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman he is fallen in love with.
So they set out to try the the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in the village.
"Even though the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it, they eventually find that it fits cinderella."
They live happily every after.
I would open both jars.
I would find a knife.
First i would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread.
Then i would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread.
Since there is only one piece of bread i would then fold it in half and make a sandwich.
Wow well the first thing that came into my mind because i will i will take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place.
So it is a trauma event where my grandfather passed away.
He went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work.
So he went off on a normal day.
I remember playing you know with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital.
A friend of mine and i made put some cookies together and for when he was going to come home because it was my first experience with the death.
But i just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the cycle of birth and death and whatnot.
So it turned out he passed away that night.
I never did see him again.
I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and i had a very close relationship.
So that was probably the most traumatic event of something that i would remember from my life.
I did not realize it then but i came to believe.
I do not know if you want to know about my personal beliefs but i believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there.
It just served as a a real learning in my life in many different ways.
Okay well this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went out of the way and broke the window.
Lo and behold his dad was sitting in the living room.
The ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad.
The dad stood up and looked out the window and probably did not see the boy because the boy ran away in fear.
Mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella.
But he did not want to take the umbrella because he did not want to be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain.
So he went on his way.
He got caught in the rain.
It started to rain very hard.
He got very wet.
He came home.
He got the umbrella.
Then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom.
It was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson.
As they were going along they noticed that a cat was running along the field.
A dog was chasing it.
Do not you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree.
She was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so.
She encouraged her dad to get the ladder bebecause they lived right across the street.
The dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree.
But then he got stuck in the tree.
Looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down.
So i am sure someone had a cell phone in this picture even though it is not shown.
So the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat.
They all lived happily ever after.
Okay once upon a time there was a young girl.
She hadta go live with her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad could not take care of her anymore.
So he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived.
They took the the girl in.
Turned out they really did not treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted.
Her name was then cinderella because she spent a lot of time among the cinders by the fireplace.
In the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball.
All of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball.
So when they got the announcement cinderella knew about it.
But of course the wicked stepmother was not going to let cinderella go to the ball.
But she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball.
So the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things.
Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house.
Then they saw how sad she was.
They wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such.
But cinderella i guess she knew in her heart that she could not really go to the ball.
So as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go.
They had beautiful dresses.
She hadta help mend them.
Let us see what happened.
She i think she went out in the garden.
She met her fairy godmother because she was sad.
She was crying.
She really wanted to go to the ball.
Her fairy godmother had said you know.
You may go to the ball just change.
She changed her frock into a beautiful dress.
She said.
Shen the three mice came.
They became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin.
When she got there the ball was in full swing.
The stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the the prince.
"Unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious, they really were not gracious people."
One had a tic and a creaky knee.
Then when cinderella came all eyes turned to her.
She came down the stairs and danced with the prince.
There was this magical thing that happened that we would like to think is love.
They were dancing and whatnot and really connecting.
Suddenly the clock struck twelve.
She realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight.
With that she ran away.
In doing so her glass slipper remained behind.
She made her way home.
She was a little sad because she thought she would never see this prince again.
Then the prince found the slipper.
He was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper.
So he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on.
Then they did come to the home where cinderella lived.
Then they the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot.
Then somehow cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe.
It fits.
They get married and live happily ever after.
That was not the best version of the story that i have ever heard.
Well if i were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would open up the freezer and get some glutenfree bread out of there.
I would put a paper towel on the counter.
I would put the slices of bread on the paper towel.
Then i would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly.
I would retrieve from the drawer a implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly.
I would then open up the peanut butter.
I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread.
Then i would close the jar.
Then i would open the jelly jar.
I would take a nice heaping.
I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around.
Then i would put the top on the bread.
I would close up the jelly and put the knife and the spoon in the sink.
Then i would put my sandwich probably on a plate.
I probably would not cut it.
I would go sit down.
I would enjoy a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich.
Okay i would like to tell you the story about my grandfather.
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street.
It was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom.
You you went out the door and came in for lunch.
Then you went out the door.
There were lots of fun adventures to be had.
That he hadta go to the hospital from work.
So my friend and i remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home he will have these cookies.
Then the next morning i remember waking up.
I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like.
"I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that you know he was not coming home and just as a child, an innocent child kind of coming to terms with life and death saying “wow” and really being blindsided by the whole thing."
You know my four sisters were there and my cousin who is in the nursing home.
She was around because she she kind of lived with us for awhile.
I remember she slapped me because i was crying so hard.
All the adults went to the funeral at night.
I just remembered that.
I i felt very alone in my grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who is my grandfather.
But anyway that that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future.
I remember a time when i was in sixth grade.
We were having a sleepover in my friend's back yard.
Happened to be with a a girl who lost her dad in the newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to leukemia a the other girl who lost her grandmother.
I had lost my grandfather.
We it was like they they could make a movie about the bond.
And we were just talking.
I can see us all sitting there.
We each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life.
We put it out there.
It was probably the safest place to ever let it go.
We all just just let it out.
I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like i could share this.
So that is why i think this story is is so important to me was because it is something that affected my life you know as i grew up.
Also as i had mentioned yesterday that i did not know about angels then.
But now i believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe.
He can sort of watch over me if you will.
"Yeah, one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball, kicking the ball."
Inadvertently it went through the window of his his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper.
The ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp.
He stood up and looked out the window.
He saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window.
He kind of shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing.
He was going to go speak to his son about that.
Before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said.
"Johnny, take your umbrella."
He said.
I do not think it is going to rain today so i i do not want to take it.
So off he went without his umbrella.
Sure enough it started to rain.
It it started to rain harder.
He got wet.
So he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said.
I needed my umbrella.
Then he took his umbrella and went off.
Mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of taking her advice next time.
Okay sally and her dad were walking around the park one day.
Sally was riding her tricycle.
As they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree.
She urged to help the cat.
So he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree.
Then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over.
Some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the fire department.
Sure enough the fire department came to help retrieve the dad from the tree and the cat.
Once upon a time in a land far away there was a little girl named cinderella.
She was brought to the home of a a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her.
She thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters.
But as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was her stepmom.
They actually put her to work.
She hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose.
"She busied herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the birds and such."
"She was a very kindred spirit, that cinderella."
She got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride.
They invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom.
In her heart she thought.
Oh i would just love to go to that ball.
She soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of course she was not going to go to the ball because she was just cinderella.
But the stepsisters were going to go.
She hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball.
She went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said.
"We will help you, cinderella."
They brought out some ribbon and some some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her.
She had the dress.
But she had no way of getting to the ball.
She was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared.
Her my fairy godmother said.
I know you want to go to the ball.
And i can help you.
I will turn it into a coach.
So she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the the coachmen.
Off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world.
When she got there she approached the ball and looked down the stairs.
There everyone was dancing.
They saw her come in.
They turned and looked at her.
The prince looked.
He thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen.
He invited her to dance.
They just had a nice connection.
She engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing.
Suddenly the time had gone by.
She had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight.
So quick she ran from the castle.
In doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper.
She found her way home.
The prince retrieved the slipper and was determined to find the fair maiden who left it there.
So he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them.
Everyone tried on the slipper.
When he came to the house where cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper.
It did not quite work.
But the cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs.
The mice gave her the key.
She got out.
She came down.
She said she would like to try on the slipper.
With that she tried on the slipper.
Her step wicked stepmother and her sisters were amazed that she could have been that beautiful person that night.
But as it was they she tried on the slipper.
He knew that she was the princess that he wanted.
They got married.
They lived happily ever after.
I would like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness.
Yes well if i were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would get two pieces of glutenfree bread from the freezer.
I would get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon.
I would open up the peanut butter.
I would scoop out some peanut butter spread it on the bread.
I would use the spoon to get the jelly out of the jar.
I would put it on the other slice of bread.
I would put the peanut butter and jelly back.
I would put the other piece of bread on top of the sandwich.
I probably would not cut it in half.
I would take it to a table.
I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Mhm i can remember when i was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before christmas.
You know periodically she would be in the hospital.
We got a call that she had passed away.
My mother hadta contact my dad.
I remember that was the first time i ever heard my father cry.
So it was really something that i think i really remember.
In addition to me being sad i thought about how difficult it was for my father.
Back then we always decorated our tree and everything on christmas eve.
We put everything up then.
Then we would get up.
So my mother did have all of us do that.
But i remember thinking how sad my mom was.
My dad did not come home until very late.
Then he was there of course on christmas morning when we got up.
I do remember that very vividly.
One cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school.
He said.
I will not need the umbrella.
However when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard.
It rained and rained.
He hadta run through the puddles.
He got wet.
He tried to cover his head with his hands.
When he got home his mother said.
You are soaking wet.
He thought about having an umbrella.
The next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson.
One day a girl was riding her bicycle.
She saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard.
She looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat.
She went and got her dad who brought a ladder.
He started to climb the tree.
The ladder fell.
So now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree.
Someone called the fire department.
They were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad.
Cinderella's mother passed away when she was a little girl.
Her father was raising her.
He met a woman that he thought would be a good wife.
She had three daughters of her own.
They got married.
They lived together.
But cinderella was not treated fairly there.
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores.
The stepsisters would say.
Cinderella get my lunch.
Cinderalla clean the laundry.
Cinderella you know do everything.
One day an invitation came that all of the young girls in the village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince.
They needed to find a suitable wife for the prince.
So cinderella heard about it.
She dreamt of going.
The mice and the animals helped her.
They made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night.
But when it was time to come they said that she could not go.
The wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly.
The wicked stepmother would not let her go.
They locked her away.
But the mice came and they helped her.
They got the keys.
They opened the door.
She helped cinderella.
There was a beautiful dress for her.
She changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen.
But she did tell cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight.
So cinderella went.
She danced.
Sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her.
But then the clock struck twelve.
Out cinderella ran out of the ball.
As she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes.
She made it back the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters.
A few days later some of the prince's men came.
They had cinderella's shoe.
They said we can try this on.
Whoever it fits will go and meet the prince.
All of the stepsisters tried it on.
Cinderella i i believe locked away then too because they knew the stepmother and the stepsisters knew she had been at the ball.
They realized.
So i think they had locked her away at that point as well.
They helped her get out.
She tried on the shoe.
Sure enough it fit.
They lived happily ever after.
Well first you would get out your bread and a knife.
You would open your peanut butter and spread some peanut butter on the bread.
Then i would get a clean knife.
I do not mix my peanut butter and jelly.
I would open the jelly and spread the jelly on top of that.
My mother said if you cut it in half it is a little extra love in that sandwich.
So we would always cut that in half as well.
Mhm i can think about the day that i got engaged.
I guess that was an important day in my life.
I remember i was student teaching as a speech language pathologist.
I was working hard.
Back then we did not have super duper speech company so we hadta make everything.
I had contact paper that i was laminating pictures with.
Oh let us go over to the park.
Let us do this.
He was acting kind of funny.
I thought.
I do not really have time for this.
Even when he came to the house he was acting kind of funny.
I said.
Oh you know i really wanted to finish what i was doing.
So we went to brookdale park which is where we live right now across the street from brookdale park now.
That was the day that he asked me to marry him.
Then i went home.
My my parents knew.
So then they had invited my brothers over.
I kept thinking.
But i really hafta get back to what i am doing.
But i guess i was a conscientious student then too.
I think so.
Because the next day i went in you know to where i was doing my student teaching.
It was nice to tell my cooperating teacher.
One day a boy was playing soccer.
He went to kick the ball to his friend.
But he kicked it through a window his neighbor's window.
His neighbor had been sitting there watching television and was very alarmed and upset that the ball came through the window.
When the neighbor looked to see who had kicked the ball the boy had run off.
One cloudy day a mom was encouraging her son to take his umbrella to school with him.
She warned him a second time before he left.
But he said.
No i do not need it.
I guess hoping that it would not rain.
But sure enough it did rain that day.
It rained on the way to school and on the way home from school.
When the boy got home he was soaking wet.
His mother looked at him and said.
I had told you that you should bring your umbrella today.
Then from then on he carried his umbrella and learned a lesson.
Okay one beautiful day a cat ran outside.
A dog chased it up the tree.
A little girl was riding her tricycle and saw that it was her cat stuck on a branch in the tree.
She ran and got her father who got a ladder and tried to help her retrieve the cat.
But the ladder slipped off of the tree.
Now both the dad and the cat were stuck in the tree.
The mom called the fire department.
They came.
They were going to help both the dad and the cat get down from the tree.
Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away.
Her father married a wicked woman.
She had two daughters of her own.
They maltreated cinderella.
She hadta bring them breakfast.
She hadta make their dresses.
One day where they lived an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land.
All of the unmarried women area were invited to the ball.
The two stepsisters were going to go.
Cinderella helped them get ready.
She on her own made her own dress actually of the animals.
So they made a beautiful dress.
Then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her.
They ripped her dress and tore her dress.
They told her she could not go.
She cried and cried.
They left.
She cried.
Then all of a sudden a fairy godmother appeared.
She told cinderella.
I can help you get to the ball.
She used her magic wand and made a beautiful dress.
She turned the pumpkins into a coach.
She had coachmen come.
Cinderella got to go to the ball.
Sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did fall in love with her.
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that cinderella hadta be home at midnight.
That if she was not home when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form.
It was getting closer and closer.
She did not realize.
All of a sudden the clock struck.
She ran out of the ball.
As she ran down the steps she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers.
The prince found it.
That was all that was left of cinderella.
So the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him.
They said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this fragile glass slipper that would be cinderella.
So the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away.
They tried on the the glass slipper.
But it did not fit either of them.
The mice snuck the key under the door to cinderella.
She was able to get out just in time so that she could try on the glass slipper.
Sure enough it fit.
The prince's servants brought her back to the castle.
She and the prince lived happily ever after.
Okay so first i would have two slices of bread.
Then i would have a knife.
I would open the jar of peanut butter and get some peanut butter on my knife and spread it on the one slice of the bread.
Then i would use another knife.
Then i would open the jar of jelly and use the knife to spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter on the bread.
Then i would put the second slice of bread on top.
Then i would cut the sandwich in two.
I guess i will tell you about when we adopted our daughter grace.
It was a lot you know a lot of discussion with my wife eileen about possibly doing it.
We probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents.
We were trying to take care of them.
Then it would swap.
It went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind of we were on the same page at the same time.
We made this decision to to that we should look possibly look at foster care.
We looked into it closely.
It just was not going to work right for us.
Then we decided to to adopt.
We identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family.
We looked into all of her medical records and things.
Then we traveled to china.
It was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that.
Actually the adoption occurred there in china.
We have an older daughter who came with us also.
Well there was a little boy who was playing practicing his soccer kicks.
Looks like he kicked the ball a little too hard right through the living room window where his father was sitting there watching tv and keeping an eye on the baby.
His father hadta gather up the ball and look out the window at him and and say you know.
What are you doing kicking the ball right near the window?
It looks like there a little girl's cat climbed up the tree.
The girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard.
The cat ran up the tree.
She went in to get her father to help her.
He got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air get the cat out.
The while once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too.
So they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree.
The little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out of the tree.
Okay there was a little girl named cinderella.
Her mother died.
Her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own.
The new mother the stepmother did not really care for cinderella that much.
Then as they grew up the the she made cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her.
One day there was a an invitation to a a big ball to meet the prince bebecause the prince was looking for a wife.
His father was having a big party a big ball to so he could meet all the eligible women kingdom.
So she wanted to go to the the ball.
Her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for everybody else because they all hadta have their clothes made cleaned and ready to go.
So she in she started to get everybody's everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball.
In the meantime her friends the the the mice put sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball.
Once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go.
But the sisters found out.
They tore up her dress.
She thought she would never get to the ball.
Then she met her her fairy godmother.
She went out in the yard and was crying.
The fairy godmother came.
The fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the the mice into horseses and the dog into a horseman and gave her a beautiful dress and sent her off to the ball.
But told her that she needed to leave by twelve of the clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point.
So she went off to the ball.
She met the prince.
They fell in love.
All of a sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight.
So she hadta run out.
She ran down the steps of the the castle.
She lost her shoe on the way.
So the prince thought he would never see his this girl again.
So the next day the father and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on.
So then she married the prince and lived happily ever after.
I would take the bread.
I would open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread.
I will talk about my other daughter.
When erin was born and we it was a little postdated the energy where eileen was having the baby.
She was a little bit late so they decided they would induce her.
She we went to the hospital.
It was all planned.
It was only going to be a couple of hours.
It ended up being of course like thirteen hours.
But the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and eileen's parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby.
I have three brothers.
So it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl.
So you know the whole thing was just that being that we knew the day going to happen there was a little more planning to be done.
But it made it so exciting because we knew our that the grandparents could be there.
You know it could be exciting for everybody.
So the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air.
He kicks it just a little bit too hard.
It goes through the window of the house.
Lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over.
His father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily.
I am sure he is on the other end running from his father.
The little boy is getting ready to go to school.
His mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and because it is sposta rain.
He tells her he does not need it.
He walks out the door.
You know he just barely gets away from the house.
It starts really raining hard.
So he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her.
You know what you were right.
I needed the umbrella after all.
The little girl's cat climbed up the tree.
It was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog.
She so the cat got stuck in the tree.
The little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out.
But when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell.
So then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father and get the barking dog away from the tree.
So once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone.
The father met a a woman and decided to get married.
This woman had two daughters.
The so the they became a family.
Quickly the new mother who became hostile toward cinderella in favor of her own daughters.
So she they forced cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the stepmother and the stepmother's two daughters.
As they grew up cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody.
Then one day there was going to be a ball.
The king was going to have a a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife.
He invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party.
Cinderella wanted to go.
But her her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody else's needs were taken care of first her the two sisters' dresses were ready and everything else.
So cinderella got it all ready.
In the meantime her the mice sewed a a beautiful dress for cinderella to wear.
So after she got everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself.
Then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs.
They tore it and tore it basically off of her.
So she thought she would not be able to go to the ball.
Then she ran out into the back garden of the castle and was crying.
She met her fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother told her that you are going to go to the ball.
She turned a pumpkin into a coach.
She gave cinderella a beautiful gown.
She turned the mice into the horses.
She went off to the ball.
But there was one stipulation is that she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was.
So she went to the ball.
She met the prince.
They fell in love.
Then the all of a sudden she heard the clock strike twelve.
She immediately tried ran out of the ball hadta get out of there before she turned back into cinderella.
She lost her shoe on the step palace.
But there was nothing she could do.
She just kept running.
The next day the king's minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe.
They found that it was cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who could not fit into it.
They found cinderella fit into the shoe.
She married the prince and lived happily ever after.
I would put the bread down.
Then i would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread.
Then i would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter.
Oh i have had so many happy things.
I am sure the happiest day was the day joseph was born.
I had a wonderful doctor.
My husband joe who had a little too much background in language problems that can occur with babies and children made sure that i was never taking anything during the pregnancy like monosodium glutamate like diet anything like chinese food.
Whatever the heck his he worried about my doctor removed from the diet.
So when it was time for joseph to be born i tried very hard to keep everything very natural.
We had gone to childbirth preparation classes.
So when the day come came i for joseph's birth i was one lesson short course i guess of childbirth preparation.
So i was going fine without any medication.
It was just taking awhile.
Then i said to them.
This is all i know.
I do not know any more.
So they were laughing.
They said.
We will take over.
They just pushed my head from the pillow and said.
Let us line up the mirror correctly.
Everything was going fine.
Everything was going fine.
Doctor sobol my doctor said.
Firstname this is going on.
I want to get home for supper.
I said.
I will get you home in time.
So it was a little bit longer but at five twenty on december ninth ninety sixty nine joseph was born.
It was the way joe had hoped without any interference.
He got a really nice apgar score.
So i said.
Once upon a time a bright and sunny day little ned is kicking the soccer ball.
Not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair.
Shocked out of his ennui he looks out the window and with ball in hand has judged correctly that he is going to hafta go outside and speak to little ned.
Well i think this is my daughter inlaw tanya.
Tanya is trying to convince nick that he must take an umbrella with him to school that day.
As he is waving goodbye he is reassuring my daughter inlaw that he surely does not need an umbrella independent little soul that he is.
Within the first block on the way to school he it begins to rain.
As he is sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he understands what his mom was trying to say after all.
A bit reluctantly he has returned home and just hasta stand there sopping wet while my daughter inlaw tries very hard not to say.
I told you so.
But he he happily accepts an umbrella and returns to school in the opposite direction it looks like.
Well this is boyle who has noticed that her cat fluffernutter is up in the tree.
And has called the only person she knows who can rescue fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household.
He has gone to help her climbs the tree.
But the ladder has gotten away from him.
As if things are not noisy enough the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark.
"So now the neighbors have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue in this order dad, fluffernutter."
They are not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because he is the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with.
There you go.
There was a a widower with a daughter whose name was cinderella who had remarried a a mean woman.
He did not know that at the time but that is what marriage reveals over time.
She had two two daughters.
So his stepdaughters were part of the household that cinderella and her father had enjoyed.
But things changed once they all arrived together.
Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude.
The stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way.
She performed servile tasks.
At one point an invitation comes to a ball.
They are considering happily going.
Cinderella's face is lighting up.
But she does not realize what is going on.
The ball was held because the the king decided that it was time for the son to marry.
So the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town.
Well cinderella would love to go.
It just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the stepmother stepsisters had the focus only on themselves.
So they prepared had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy.
But there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family.
Well there is a book and the picture book i do not remember at all.
She discovers a book.
I do not know if that is where she comes across an incantation.
But a fairy godmother appears.
Because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her.
Fairy godmother helps her.
So cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too.
As as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball i am going to just remember that she dances with the handsome prince.
At as she tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair.
I did not see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though.
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight.
But she hadta get out of there by midnight.
She does.
But then there is the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night.
But as i said the book seems a little bit different.
There is a key.
I do not remember that part.
But as i just remember the story ends happily.
That he does find her and the slipper.
They are reunited.
Well i would keep all my ingredients at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly.
I begin with spreading a a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the the well around all four sides so that when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it does not actually go over the side.
It just stays within the the borders.
I useta like mine folded over.
I think i i like it just the one slice.
So it just looks really kind of beautiful with a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle.
It was i am sure the most important thing that ever happened.
The most memorable day was the day our son was born.
But i think when i just go back to meeting joe and how how interesting that all was.
In those days freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus.
We hadta sing the the alma mater.
He noticed the sign and said something about.
I think part of it was covered.
He said.
I said.
I i unveiled the the words english.
So i got to meet one of the you know the upperclassmen got his signature.
We talked a little.
He he continued whenever i saw him to say hi.
I people would tell me.
You know he was a a vice president of student government.
I said.
But the more we hadta talk about.
I thought when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee.
But it turned out that he was interested.
Joe had probably arranged for them to come.
So we we paced ourselves you know to to be logical about things.
Because you have time with a person and you you see them in all the seasons and all.
I think everyone around us assumed we would marry.
So we did.
So i i was not engaged.
You know i was pinned.
Someone said to me the next day.
You know you are you are engaged to be engaged.
I said.
They said.
Well that is what that means.
I said.
Oh i thought it meant sort of going steady college style.
They said.
I said.
Well we have some time to go before.
I said.
It means what it means to the individual couple too.
So i tried to assert myself.
But i guess they might have been right.
It did not mean anything.
But when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross i mean that is that is probably the most important thing that happened was college and joe and getting married.
All that happened at once.
It all converged.
It is alright that we have done this before?
No this must be bigger ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself.
It goes right through a window.
We hear the crash.
The lamp has gone over.
And i am assume this is pop or a neighbor but somebody who is startled that this intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture.
He says.
I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard.
It is still raining.
Mom is telling little sweetie.
Take your umbrella with you because i think it is going to rain today.
The little little sammy this time says.
No no no no no i do not need it i am a big kid.
As he says goodbye his mom is just offering it one more time.
He says.
But as he steps out the door would not you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall.
As he is getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says.
When he gets home and looks at mom i think she is restraining the.
I told you.
He is looking a bit sheepish little sammy.
But he is still going in the opposite direction here.
We are in a time warp you know?
You guys have not moved forward from last last week.
I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb.
The ladder that he must have taken to to get to to the cat has fallen.
So he is stranded.
Little fido is barking and saying.
What the heck are you doing up there?
Kindly neighbors must have called and said.
So they are rushing along with the ladder.
They will rescue him shortly.
I think they will get dad down before they get the cat down.
I think that is the priority.
The bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world.
It is all going to work out just fine.
Alright i think last time it was a combination as well.
What once upon a time there was a widow and his daughter named cinderella.
Apparently he was interested in introducing her to a woman he had met.
But the woman had two daughters of her own.
So after the introduction and i assume the marriage after the woman and her daughter the became the stepmother and the stepsisters and joined the the household of cinderella and her dad.
I am assuming he traveled on business because he is away as i look at the pictures again.
She must deal with her new family.
There is they are mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother.
So she did the chores and she was treated badly.
Simultaneously there is another father ib and a offspring a prince this time.
The king lives in a palace with his handsome son.
I assume that it is time for him to be married.
So a ball is going to be held during which will have a chance to look over the beautiful maidens who are available.
An invitation goes out to the household.
Everyone is smiling.
Cinderella assumes that she might be able to go.
But this is not going to happen.
But she i maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house.
The little animals or begin to help out.
But somewhere along the line cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready.
Cinderella now knows that with the help of her godmother she will get to go.
There is a little admonition from after she is dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably.
Then it switches ball.
The prince sees and falls in love with at first sight this beautiful cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty.
When he could see all that.
So they dance and dance.
At the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase.
I guess the first vp of the king is running after her to say.
But she runs back to to home.
Then comes the search for who matches the slipper.
It is the first vice president then who comes to the door.
There is a funny little picture of somebody tripping and a cushion.
But i do not remember any of that from my stories or my film memory.
There was a key there that still does not mean anything much to me.
They must have let him in.
The the match is made when she tries on the slipper.
So i i suppose the the fella runs back to tell the prince.
We have got our girl.
My memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot.
I do not know why i thought it was direct.
But he could afford to hire help to do that so so the help took care of it.
They they get back together again.
Did you try it with the little wall?
Did we say there is only one piece of bread and we think two?
We can do it either way.
We will do a half one this time.
We will use the just the one piece of bread but we are going to make it the same way.
We are going to lay all the ingredients out first because i am analretentive.
We get everything out.
We open up the peanut butter first.
We spread a a thinnish layer in the middle because we are going to need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges.
All four edges will have a slightly raised perimeter.
We are going to put red raspberry jelly.
Spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that does not cross over the walls so it does not hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your your hand as you are enjoying.
But you can have a half peanut butter sandwich.
If you like you can fold it over which was the way a lot of people in my neighborhood did it.
But i think that is it.
That is how we will do it.
"That i do know the day of the week in december, december ninth."
It was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that that we found out that my wife was pregnant.
"So his his the announcement of the fact that my wife was pregnant and then his being born are happy memories prompted by , as i said , today because of of the of saint joseph's day."
Feast day in roman catholic calendar that comes just after saint patrick's day which overshadows overshadows it.
"It is as the irish celebrate saint patrick's, i think saint joseph's day is mostly celebrated by the italian americans and by italians."
There is a special pastry that is consumed.
It is called a zeppole or the the donut of saint joseph.
"Meant my son's birthdate, we prepared for childbirth."
It was very early in the time when the socalled painless childbirth developed or lamaze.
But the hospital at which my wife was to deliver did not allow fathers in the waiting room.
So even though for the day of birth going to lamaze classes.
Pun intended.
"When push came to shove, i could not go into the waiting room."
So i hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days.
But i was with her up to her being taken into delivery.
And i we did use some of the coaching.
And she did employ some of the techniques that were taught to her.
"A boy is kicking a soccer ball which goes through a house window, smashes the glass."
It is falling into the lap of a man who is sitting in a chair in the house.
"He picks up the ball, actually looks through the hole in the window."
The mother is handing an umbrella to her child because it is probably raining outside.
He is saying.
"No, i will not do not want the umbrella."
He walks outside.
It is raining.
He runs back with the rain drenching him.
She is frowning.
"The boy's frowning, soaking wet."
"He leaves the house, this time with the umbrella."
Well a cat is stuck up in the tree.
This child's father probably he he did climb the tree to try to get the cat.
But he now himself is stuck up there.
The dog is barking at him.
Someone called the fire department.
Two firemen are rushing over with a ladder.
They are going to take him down as well as retrieve the cat.
Cinderella is a young girl who whose mother died.
She is brought by her father to live with i a sister of his who herself has three girls about cinderella's age.
Father meant well.
But the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought and her daughters treated cinderella shamefully.
"She became their maid essentially and hadta clean the house, take care of the fireplace, hence the name cinderella, do the cooking, do the washing while they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to to please themselves."
They they lived principality.
The prince whose father wanted him to marry was told that there would be a ball held at which all of the single women in the principality would would be invited.
The idea would be that the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife.
Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball.
Of course cinderella is excluded.
She cannot go to the ball.
So she is left at home alone while the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball.
She is visited by her fairy godmother who grants her her wish of attending the ball.
Because cinderella says.
How am i going to get there?
What am i going to wear?
"So the fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her out of magic, takes a pumpkin, causes it to become a coach."
Mice become the horses.
I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too.
I forget which animal becomes the coachman.
They take her to the ball.
She is not really recognized by her stepsisters and and the stepmother.
But they the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight.
Otherwise or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was.
"The coach would become the pumpkin again, etcetera."
So she promises to return at midnight.
But she is having so much fun that she is still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight.
So she panics.
"Runs, gets back in the coach, and is taken home."
But one of her slippers glass slippers that was part of what the fairy godmother made for her is left behind.
The prince at at the ball was captivated by cinderella and wanted to to know who she was.
Because she was going to be the one.
The only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind.
So he has all of the young ladies principality try the slipper on.
It their it is brought to each of their houses.
The of course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for the one who was at the ball.
"And, sure enough, it is cinderella's foot that fits the glass slipper, to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and but to her great delight."
The prince marries her.
They live happily ever after.
Well i would take two pieces of bread.
"On one of them, i would take a knife and spread the peanut butter."
"On the other piece of bread, i would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together."
I would have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well i guess one of the most important things.
"Last week i mentioned my son's birth, so i i will not go through that again."
Another milestone was was getting a job at montclair state.
But i missed interacting with students.
And and i some experience in doing that because i my undergraduate degree was in history.
I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that.
"But then things things sort of changed, obviously."
But i i i missed that kind of interaction.
I worked mostly with children when i was a speech clinician.
Firstname was teaching english at the high school level.
She would come back home with stories about you know working with students and discussions they had in class.
"So when i was invited to to become an instructor here, i jumped at the chance."
That that changed everything.
I was warned that from from friends colleagues that i was taking a big risk in in doing this because i was not going to get tenure.
That i was going to be taken advantage of.
I do not know where they got the idea.
"But that you know i work for x number of years and when it came time for tenure, not get tenure."
But i wanted to be in the classroom so much.
It was actually teaching that drew me to it.
That i said.
You know i am going to do it.
So i i did.
It it changed everything.
"That was a very, very positive event you know."
I spent forty five years after that being here.
Okay a young boy is kicking a soccer ball.
"But when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbor's house or maybe his own house and lands on the lap man sitting in a chair who then gets up, holds the ball in his hand, and looks out the the hole in the window."
That is where it ends.
"So we do not know if he is going to run after the kid, if the kid is his own child, or what."
But he is just i guess staring in disbelief that this happened.
"This is a story about not listening to your mom, especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella."
Mother is suggesting that he he do that.
There is it is going to rain.
He is he is rejecting the whole thing.
Mother's a bit dismayed because he is not taking the umbrella.
"And, sure enough, once he is outside it starts to rain hard enough that he hasta run back to the house."
He is soaking wet.
Mother is looking at him almost saying.
"See, i told you show so."
"Next we see he is out, back in the rain, but with the umbrella."
Well it seems as though this young girl's father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat who is up on a limb.
He himself though ends up being stuck.
His facial expression indicates that he he is having difficulty moving one way or the other.
"Being of no help, the dog is barking, making a racket."
Someone evidently called the fire department.
Two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder.
They are going to try to get him down.
Father's ladder is on the ground i guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him.
"So the fire fire department has come to rescue him and the cat, i hope."
I guess she is a teenager.
Whose mother dies and father remarries.
She is introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters.
They immediately take advantage of cinderella.
She becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and hasta attend to their needs and the needs of the household.
Evidently father was of no help in mediating any of this.
"So the girl ends up being in a household but but being rather a member of the household being a a servant, as i said."
One day a ball is announced.
She she lives in a principality headed by you know royalty.
One day a ball is announced.
"If i recall correctly, it is because the prince is in need of finding a wife."
His father tells him that it is time for him to marry.
So a ball is organized.
All of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend.
The three stepsisters and and their their mother go plan to go.
They get their gowns ready.
Cinderella hasta help them with that too.
But it turns out that she is not going to be allowed to go.
The the the the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball.
Fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to cinderella.
You are going to go too.
We are going to get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen.
I guess the mice too become horses.
"I am not sure which animals become the horses, maybe the mice."
Cinderella's outfitted with a gown and a pair of glass slippers.
I do not know.
But she is told she hasta get home by by midnight.
"Because at the stroke of twelve, everything's going to turn back to what it was."
The coach will become the pumpkin.
The coachmen will become the mice.
She will lose her beautiful clothing.
"So she goes to the ball, promises to to leave by twelve."
But she is having a great time.
"She is still dancing when the clock strikes twelve, but gets out in time and gets gets back home in time."
"But as she is running out, one of her slipper slippers comes off."
The prince picks it up.
It turns out that she is the one that he wants.
He figures he will be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady glass slipper.
So a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper.
The the the stepsisters of course try.
They do not fit.
They try to push their feet into that slipper.
It does not work.
"And, lo and behold, cinderella's foot fits perfectly."
They end up being married and live happily ever after.
"Well, as i said before, i am not very good at nutrition."
So i would not use what looks like whole wheat bread.
"I would use american white bread, two slices."
"On one slice, i would spread the peanut butter."
"The other slice, i would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich."
There is this boy named john outside playing soccer.
He is running around just getting his exercise done.
He accidentally kicks the ball through a window.
It breaks through this guy's house named matt.
So when john kicks this ball through the window matt catches it.
It knocks over his lamp and causes some damage.
Then matt either decides.
I can do one of two things.
I can throw it back and get in trouble or i can get him in trouble.
Or i can sit here and maybe help him out and say it is okay.
Mistakes happen and stuff.
So he is looking at him deciding what to do and he decides.
He is just a little kid so i am going to give it back to him.
Just cleans up his mess and fixes the window.
This mom is talking to her son right before he goes off to school.
He is walking himself to school.
So mom wants to go ahead and give him an umbrella so he can walk and not get wet.
But the little kid decides he does not want one.
He can do it on his own.
He can walk there and be just fine.
So he decides to go ahead and start walking to school.
Then it starts pouring on him.
"He gets all upset , gets very sad , soaking wet , tries to cover himself up."
His mom's very upset with him for saying.
You should have brought the umbrella.
This is what happens.
He learns.
Then tomorrow when he goes to off to school he decides to bring the umbrella.
She is sitting at home with him and accidentally leaves the door open.
So the cat gets outside and runs up a tree.
The little girl decides she needs to go try and get her down.
So she is sitting there trying to reach for the cat but cannot get her down.
When she goes outside she still has the door open.
"So the dog goes out and is trying to get the cat , chase her around."
She still cannot get it.
So she calls for some help from her neighbor who tries to get him but ends up getting stuck in the tree as well and cannot get him.
"So when the dog is still trying to get the cat , the cat will not come down."
The man is now stuck in the tree.
The girl calls for firemen to come help that cat get down.
They come and then get the dog and the cat back inside.
Then the man gets down.
He meets this woman who has two evil stepdaughters.
When they get married they all move in together.
They never really got along with cinderella.
"After her father passes away , she is left with her stepmom and the two sisters."
"Then her stepmom chooses to make her be like a servant to them and clean like a maid , a house , all those things."
But she still tries to be very sweet.
She has really good relationships with animals.
That is where she provides kind of her comfort and friends and stuff like that.
The king is trying to find his son a wife to get married to.
So they throw this big grand ball.
In this ball they cordially invite all these girls.
They invite the stepmom and stepsisters and cinderella.
But the stepmom and sisters say cinderella is not allowed to go.
She has her dress made.
When she goes downstairs they literally laugh at her and say like.
You are not going.
Then she gets a fairy godmother.
"The fairy godmother puts her in a beautiful gown , changes a pumpkin into a carriage , the mice into horse , and all these things."
She is got glass slippers on.
She meets the prince.
They have a perfect night.
"But when the clock struck strikes twelve , it would turn back into a pumpkin."
Everything would fall off.
So right before twelve she leaves him.
As she is running away she leaves a glass slipper.
This glass slipper is what the prince finds when he runs after her.
"Then they go all through the village looking for her , for the matching glass slipper."
Eventually they find cinderella and find out that it fits.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to start you would need a plate.
You would need a knife.
You get a can of peanut butter and a can of jelly.
Then you open the two pieces of bread.
You would spread peanut butter on one side.
"You can have crunchy or smooth , any kind."
"So you take the bread in your hand , dip it into the peanut butter , and spread it over."
Then you dip it into the jelly on the other side and put it all over the other piece.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
So the son went outside to play some soccer.
Looks like he had a little accident on the window.
Dad just happens to be trying to relax and watch some tv during the soccer game.
Maybe there are some consequences to follow from the broken window.
Maybe she is telling him to take the umbrella at first.
He says he does not want to.
Then maybe thinks about going to school without the umbrella in the pouring down rain and coming home soaking wet.
So maybe he changes his mind and thinks.
Sure i will take the umbrella.
So i guess the little girl has a dog and a cat maybe.
The dog chased the cat up into the tree.
Then it looks like maybe she and dad tried to get the cat down.
Then dad got stuck in the tree.
So they hadta call for backup to come help the whole situation out.
It looks like they have a dog.
Then stepmother with her two daughters show up.
They they happen to have a cat.
So so then they all move in to live together.
Cinderella tries to befriend the cat.
She she hasta kind of serve her sisters bebecause maybe they are kind of lazy.
I do not really know.
But she does everything for them.
Then it does not really show that in the book.
But her dad dies i guess.
So a letter comes.
Which i think before that cinderella was dreaming about the castle in the far off distance.
Then the letter comes.
So cinderella starts making herself a dress.
She uses a book.
She gets it all together.
Then they get ready to go to the ball.
Her stepsisters out of jealousy destroy her dress while her stepmother looks on very proudly about what is happening.
So then her stepsisters head off to the ball.
Then the fairy godmother comes.
She makes all these wonderful things happen for cinderella.
Cinderella gets to go to the ball.
She gets to dance with prince charming as her stepsisters watch enviously.
Then she hasta leave the ball in a hurry because she hasta be home by midnight.
She loses her little glass slipper in the process.
But he comes around with the glass slipper.
Well actually the i think she gets locked up.
Then her little mice friends give her a key to let her out.
"While that is happening , the little man comes with the slipper."
There is noone here.
Somehow she gets out with her little key from the mice.
She ends up with prince charming.
"You are going to need peanut butter and jelly , a knife or a spoon."
Then you may want a paper towel or a plate or something.
Then you are going to need some bread.
I guess we will make a two slice peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
So you will have two slices of bread.
You will take your knife or your spoon.
You will get some peanut butter.
You will spread it on the slice.
Then with your other slice of bread you will use your knife or your spoon whichever you prefer.
You will spread some jelly on it.
Then you will put the two slices together.
So johnny was playing out in the yard with a soccer ball and kicked it in the wrong direction.
"It ended up going through mister smith's window , broke through the window , and broke a lamp while mister smith was watching tv."
Then he picked up the soccer ball and looked out the window.
Johnny was standing there.
So jack's mom told him to grab the umbrella before he went to school.
He said.
What do you know?
He goes outside and it is raining.
He comes back home.
His mom said.
I told you so.
He grabs the umbrella and goes back out.
So jane's cat got out of the house.
"While mister rogers was walking his dog , the that his dog ran after the cat."
The cat ran up the tree.
The dog was chasing after the cat.
Of course jane is heartbroken because her cat's up in the tree.
Mister rogers feels bad.
So he tries climbing up the tree.
But he ends up getting stuck and as well as the cat.
So jane hasta call emergency department.
The firefighters are coming with the ladder to get mister rogers and the cat out of the tree.
"So when cinderella was little , her father got married to this evil woman who became her stepmother."
Also she gained two stepsisters with that.
Her father passed away.
So cinderella hadta grow up the rest of her life with this evil stepmother and her two stepsisters.
They kind of abused cinderella by making her do all of the chores.
"When cinderella got older , there was news that the prince was looking for a wife i think."
They held a ball in order for all the potential women to come and dance with the prince.
Cinderella to go.
Now is her chance to get out of the house.
Her stepmother was helping her stepsisters get ready for the ball.
"But when cinderella was trying to get ready for the ball , her stepsisters got really upset and would not let her go."
They tore up her dress.
"But then a while cinderella was crying , her fairy godmother came out of nowhere."
"Then some mice came and helped make her a beautiful dress , some glass slippers."
The fairy godmother told let her go to the ball but said to be back before midnight.
There was this.
She fairy godmother also turned a pumpkin and some mice or dogs into a horse drawn carriage.
Then they went to the ball.
Cinderella and the prince kind of fell in love.
They danced.
But then she hadta leave at midnight.
"So she as she was running out , she left her glass slipper."
Then she got into the carriage and made it all the way home just barely.
"After the ball was over , the prince wanted to find cinderella."
Now all he had was the glass slipper that cinderella left.
So the prince gave this slipper to the duke and some other guy that helps out the prince.
Now they went around the surrounding areas trying to find this magical princess.
"When they got to cinderella's house , that was cinderella's shoe."
She got really excited.
But the evil stepmother locked her away so that she could not try on the shoe.
However somehow the duke found cinderella.
Then cinderella they took cinderella to the castle.
She married the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
Do you hafta go to the grocery store too?
So you got to go to the grocery store.
You got to get bread.
Sliced bread is probably the best.
Then also you are going to get a jar of jam and a jar of peanut butter.
I prefer crunchy.
"Then when you go home in your kitchen , take out two slices of bread."
"Spread you use a butter knife to spread some peanut butter on one side of the bread , and then a spoon or a butter knife to spread the jam on the other side."
Then you got yourself a sandwich.
So it looks like some young boy was playing some soccer.
Looks like his dad's getting mad that his son kicked a ball through the window.
So a boy's refusing the advice of his mother thinking that a little bit smarter than that and does not want the umbrella for the day.
But she clearly checked the weather this morning.
"So he goes to school , finds out it is raining , turns around , comes back."
His mom's mad at him bebecause he never took the umbrella.
It looks like he dries off and goes back out with the umbrella.
So a little girl lost her cat up the tree.
Looks like her father or a good samaritan went up to try to help.
He had a small ladder.
But they should have called the professionals because now he is stuck up the tree also.
The dog barking at the base.
The firefighters are coming to get him and the cat out of the tree.
So a mother came in with her two daughters.
It looked like to an orphanage or something like that.
They picked up a third daughter.
Then she went home with them.
Then it looked like the stepdaughters were mean to her.
The mom was mean to her bebecause they all had little scowls on their faces.
So they went off to some event.
"She followed off to the event without them , or separate from them rather."
She came back from the event later on minus one slipper.
A whole quest was set out to find whose slipper it was.
So eventually the three of them and the mother showed up.
The mother did not believe it.
But sure enough the slipper fit the adopted girl.
The neighbor was watching tv.
It knocked over his lamp and made a giant hole in the window.
Now he is figuring out how he is going to get the kid to pay for it.
So the mom was trying to get the kid to carry an umbrella to school.
He said.
I am not going to take that.
So he started walking to school.
It started raining.
He got mad.
He went back and asked his mom for the umbrella.
Now he has the umbrella.
So a girl's cat got caught in a tree.
She was trying to get it down.
The mailman was also delivering mail.
He got chased from a mailbox by someone is dog.
So someone saw what was going on and called the fire department to come help them.
So cinderella her mother died.
So she lived with her dad.
So her dad remarried.
Her dad died.
So she was left with her stepmom and stepsisters.
They treated her very cruelly.
Then one day her step mom got an invite to the castle because the prince was holding a ball to find a wife.
So her daughters are going.
But cinderella tried to go.
Her stepmother would not let her.
So she i guess she was upset about it.
Then cinderella's fairy godmother came and took care of her and gave her a dress and everything and got her to the ball.
She danced with the prince.
The prince wanted to marry her.
But at twelve of the clock cinderella hadta run out because that is when the magic ran out.
She left her shoe stairs.
So they found her glass slipper.
So they went around everywhere trying to see who fit the glass slipper.
The stepmom broke cinderella's slipper.
So cinderella did not have her own to compare with it.
"But when they came to the house , they tried it on cinderella."
So you are going to buy a loaf of bread.
You can either buy white or wheat.
It does not matter.
Then you go and get peanut butter.
You could get jelly.
"It does not matter strawberry , grape , whatever kind."
Then you are going to open up the bag of bread.
You do not want to get the first slice.
You lay ththem flat like this.
"If you are like me , you are going to cut the crust off first with a knife."
Then you are going to take that knife.
You are going to dip it in the jar of peanut butter.
You are going to get a spoon.
Then you are going to scoop some jelly out.
You are going to dump it out on the other slice of bread that you did not put the peanut butter on.
You are going to smooth it over that slice of bread.
Then you are going to put the two piece together on the peanut butter and jelly side so they will be touching each other.
That is how you make it.
So once upon a time there was a a dad and a daughter.
She also had two daughters.
I think their names are anastasia and drizella.
Then cinderella's dad dies.
Cinderella's left with her stepmother and her stepsisters.
So cinderella's life pretty much consists of doing a lot of chores and taking care of her stepsisters and their mother.
She sort of dreams about being in a happier place because she is not treated very well and she hasta do all the work.
Oh but she has lots of friends with the animals that are in around the house.
So there is a horse that she is friends with and a dog and and mice and birds.
But she is not friends with the cat whose name is lucifer which i cannot understand bebecause cats are great.
So they are hosting a ball for all the eligible women in the kingdom.
Cinderella as an eligible woman actually should get to go.
Oh yes if you get all of your work done you can go i guess.
So cinderella makes plans to wear her mother's gown.
Her animal friends thinks it would be really nice to sort of upgrade her mom's dress by adding ribbon and beads and things to kind of work the ensemble.
And so cinderella works really hard.
Meanwhile her animal friends are making her dress better.
She gets done.
Then she sees her dress.
She gets ready to go to the ball.
Her stepsisters stop her.
They snatch off her necklace.
They tear the sash from her dress and basically leave her dress in ruins.
So she could not go to the ball that way.
Her animal friends are really sad because she does not get to go to the ball.
Her fairy godmother comes.
The fairy godmother arrives and helps her come up with a way to go to the ball.
She starts by making a pumpkin into a carriage and turning the animal friends into different a driver a horseman.
The she turns the mice into horses and the horse into a man which does not make sense.
But she makes the how to get there work first.
I cannot go like this.
So the fairy godmother needed to be redirected to help her with her dress.
So she creates a really lovely dress that is sort of iconic with a black choker.
She says that she should go and have a wonderful time but to remember to come home by the stroke of twelve because that says how long the spell will last.
It will all go back to the way it was.
So cinderella hears her and waves goodbye.
Then she travels to the ball where she meets the prince and dances with him.
He they sort of have the love at first sight kind of thing going on.
They dance.
Even her stepmother and stepsisters see her but do not recognize her.
They dance.
Then time goes by because they are so happy.
They time goes by that they do not realize that the time has gone by.
They are so happy they do not realize the time has gone by.
She cinderella is reminded that the spell will be over.
So she rushes away but in her haste to run away before the spell elapses she loses a glass slipper.
The prince picks it up.
He says something like.
Where will you go?
How will i find you?
She runs away.
So she had a wonderful time at the ball.
You know cinderella is ready to live pretty content on the fact that she had a really nice night.
Life sorta goes back to the way it was except for the prince is looking for her because he loves her.
So he starts visiting all the maidens in the kingdom and asking them to try on this glass slipper.
By the time the messenger arrives at their home the stepsisters and lady tramane have actually realized that the king is seeking out this mysterious girl that he met at the ball.
Lady tramane actually puts together that cinderella was at the ball because cinderella is singing a song and dancing and is happy.
So she sort of puts together that she is the mysterious girl that the prince is looking for.
She locks cinderella in her room.
Then she goes downstairs to greet them the advisor who comes with the sort of funny looking man with the shoe on a pillow to try on the shoe.
The glass slipper does not fit the anastasia and drizella's foot although they try to deceive them into thinking that it does but really their feet are too much too big.
"The animals meanwhile steal the key from lady tramane's pocket , take it all the way up the stairs , and unlock the door."
So cinderella comes out just in the nick of time.
I will try on the glass slipper.
Lady tramane trips him.
The advisor's really upset because he thinks the king is going to be mad.
But then cinderella produces the other glass slipper.
It fits.
Then she gets to be the princess.
She gets to marry the prince and be the princess.
They live happily ever after.
So there is a boy playing soccer.
He accidentally kicks the ball into a window.
It breaks the glass.
There is a gentleman in the living room and when the ball comes in and breaks the window it also knocks over a lamp.
The man looks out the window to see who broke the window.
Probably realizing there is only one child who plays soccer.
So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you needta have some ingredients.
I like preserves.
So that is what were going to go with.
I also like strawberry.
If you have good manners you put it on a plate.
You then use a knife to put peanut butter on one piece of bread.
Then if you have good manners you get a different knife.
You use it to put jelly onto the other side of the bread.
Then you put it together.
You eat it over your plate.
With your mouth closed.
If you have good manners.
This is the proper way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well it looks like the boy's playing with a soccer ball.
It it hits the window.
It goes inside.
The dad sees it.
He picks up the ball and looks outside the hole in the window.
He went outside and he noticed it was raining really hard.
So he went back home all wet.
His mom looked at him mad and gave him back his umbrella.
Then he went back outside feeling more loved now that he knows his mom looks out for him and knows best.
Looks like susie's cat got stuck in the tree.
It her dad tried to fix the problem himself and use a ladder.
But he got stuck himself.
The the firemen are on the way to help.
"She i guess that from one of the pictures , it seemed like the dad was mad that the the prince had not gotten married yet."
He had not just picked someone.
So there is a ball.
The family gets the invitation.
Cinderella wants to go.
But she does not have a dress.
So she looks up how to make one.
The creatures help.
When it is time for the ball the the the evil sisters they tear her dress apart.
They just ruin it.
So the fairy godmother comes.
She just magically gives her these things.
She goes and the prince falls in love with her.
But when the clock strikes twelve the magic fades and she hasta leave.
But on her way out the one glass slippers stays.
He goes all around trying to find her.
They finally he does.
"I remember the two big sisters , their feet were just too big."
But yeah then they get married.
"So you have two slices of bread , peanut butter , and jelly."
Oh and you have the knife.
You scoop up the peanut butter and jelly.
So there was a little boy outside playing soccer.
He was not watching what he was doing.
The ball went through the window.
The ball hit the man in the house.
The man tried to figure out who it was.
A boy was leaving to go to school.
His mom wanted him to take an umbrella.
But he told her that he did not need one.
As he was walking it started raining really hard.
He got wet.
When he got home his mom scolded him and told him that he hadta take an umbrella next time.
So he did and did not get wet.
A girl's cat went up a tree.
A nice man went to help her get the cat down.
But when his ladder fell a dog started barking at him.
They hadta call the fire department to get him and the cat down.
Got to figure out how to make it fit into a a beginning middle and end.
So there was a little girl that with her dad.
He brought in his wife and her two daughters.
As the girls got older they were mean to cinderella.
She just had her animal friends.
So he threw a party and invited everybody.
Cinderella made herself a dress so that she could go.
But the sisters destroyed the dress.
Then her fairy godmother came and made her a coach and had a nice dress so that she could go.
She had fun at the party and so did the prince.
But she hadta leave.
The prince hadta come after her to find her.
He went through.
Then she got to ride away to the castle that she had dreamed of.
You take two slices of bread.
It does not really matter what kind of bread as long as it is not moldy.
You have a jar of peanut butter.
You open it.
You take a butter knife.
You scoop out about as much of it as will fit on the butter knife.
Then you start on one edge of the bread and swipe across the bread.
Make sure that you cover all of that side of the bread with peanut butter.
Then you put the peanut butter away.
Then you rinse off your knife.
Then you get your jelly.
You open it up.
"Jelly is squiggly so you got to kind of balance it , put it on the bread , and then spread it out so the middle of the bread is covered."
You push your bread together.
You eat it.
Johnny wanted to play soccer after he got out of school.
He started playing kick really hard with the ball.
He kicked it so hard and so high he did not realize he hit a window.
The force was so hard it broke the glass and fell on top of his dad's lap.
His dad was furious when he saw the broken window.
One morning johnny wanted to go to school.
He dressed himself up completely by himself.
He his mother knew that it would rain outside and was telling him he must use the umbrella.
Oh now i see the sequence.
"As he went outside walking to school he realized that he got all wet , that he really needed the umbrella , so he hadta run back home a little embarrassed."
He told his mother he got all wet.
Then he took the umbrella that he needed all the way back to the school.
This little girl's cat ran up the tree.
As the neighbor passed by he saw that she needed her cat out of the tree.
So he decided he was going to go help get the cat out of the tree.
He got stuck in the tree.
So they needed to call help for the firefighters to come help both rescue him and the cat.
Once there was a man with a little girl.
He he his little girl did not have a mother.
So he felt sad that she needed a mother to grow up.
So he met a woman who had two girls of her own.
"They he married her , brought her to the home."
As time passed father died.
Cinderella hadta stay with mother and her two new sisters.
But as time passed by the stepmother did not favor her as much.
So it obligated her to do most of the work.
"But regardless of her condition , she was still happy and made the outlook as positive as she can with every animal or thing she had around her."
She created her own friends in her own world.
There soon she heard that there was going to be a wonderful ball occurring at the castle which made her very excited wanting and dreaming to go to it.
Stepmother knew that the ball was going to be hosted by a prince because they wanted to have a better chance in life.
They wanted to see if one of the daughters would marry into money so that they can get more money.
So she was preparing her daughters as well to be ladies to be able to go to the ball.
When cinderella asked to see if she could go to the ball they were like.
Fine but you would hafta do all these chores that could not be done in time.
"So as she continued to work hard to try to make her deadline , her stepmother and her sisters were able to go and made sure that they gave her more work before she left."
"Saddened because of the fact that she could not go , she made a wish."
As she made a wish a fairy godmother appeared to answer her plea.
But there was conditions for doing this wonderful favor.
That she could go enjoy her night but hadta return at a certain time for a deadline of midnight.
She was able to go to the ball with all the magic that was bestowed upon to her on that occasion.
"Then when she realized her time was being up she hadta run hastily prior to leaving , though her stepsisters and her stepmother were able to find out that she had joined mysteriously to the ball."
As she was leaving she accidentally left her shoe.
As she was trying to leave before anybody were to see her change she got barely home.
But she changed.
But she was still happy at the experiences that she had.
"Stepmother came home , saw knew that she to go , and saw that it was dangerous that the prince did like her more than her stepsisters."
Made sure when she heard that the royalty were coming that she would not be seen.
"Somehow she was able to escape so that she was be able to prove that she was the mysterious girl that they needed for the ball , that the prince met."
When she put on the shoe they found it was her.
You go to the store.
"You buy bread , peanut butter , and jelly."
"Bread , peanut butter , then jelly depending on which one you like."
Then you take two slices of bread.
On one side you would take a butter knife.
You grab the jelly with a butter knife as well.
Cut it up as you like.
So junior was playing with a soccer ball outside of the house.
He kicked it through the window on accident.
It landed in the living room where his dad was sitting.
His dad was upset because he told him before not to do it.
So he looked out and got ready to go out and yell at him.
His mom told him to take the umbrella because it was raining outside.
But he said he did not need it.
So he went outside.
On his way to school he got very wet and then he hadta return home.
His mom was upset because he should have taken the umbrella in the first place.
Then she gave him the umbrella.
He took it and headed back to school.
Kayla noticed that there was a cat stuck in the tree.
So she asked her dad to get a ladder and climb up to go get the cat.
Her dad climbed up.
But then the ladder fell over.
Then the neighbor's dog was barking up the tree.
So then the dad told kayla to go in the house and call the fire fighters.
So she did.
Then she came back.
Then the fire fighters came.
They brought a new ladder.
They saved the man and the cat.
So there was a girl named cinderella.
She got two new stepsisters and a stepmom.
They did not like her and neither did the stepmom.
So she did all the work around the house.
She played with the animals.
She swept and did everything.
Then she dreamed of going to the palace and having a better life.
One day the stepmom got an invitation to a ball at the castle.
They began to go get ready.
Then she cinderella wanted to go as well.
But they did not want her to go.
So she put on.
She did not have the best dress.
Then she put it on.
Then they ruined it and pulled her necklace off and broke it and everything.
Then they all left to go to the ball.
She started crying.
Then her fairy godmother appeared and told her that she could go until midnight.
"Then she a had a carriage made out of a pumpkin , horses , and a nice dress."
Her hair was done and everything.
So she went to the ball.
They wanted to know who it was.
She danced with the prince.
But then she realized it was almost midnight.
So all of her stuff would turn back to normal.
So she went back outside and was running off.
Her glass slipper fell off.
Then when the prince was trying to follow her.
But he could not catch up to her.
But he found the glass slipper.
So she got back home.
Her stepsisters and mom came back home.
They did not know that she had went.
Then the next day the prince was going around trying to find someone whose foot fit the slipper glass slipper.
Finally she tried it on and it fit.
They went off and got married and lived happily ever after.
So first you would needta wash your hands.
Then you go into the kitchen and get a loaf of bread.
You take the tie.
There is usually a twist tie on the bread.
So you take it off and open the pack.
"If it is a brandnew pack , you probably want to throw away the first piece , the end piece."
You probably do not want to use that.
But you grab two pieces of bread.
You could put ththem on a plate or a napkin separately.
Then you go and grab a knife and peanut butter and the jelly.
So first you are going to choose either the peanut butter or the jelly.
But let us just go with the peanut butter.
So you will twist the top off of the peanut butter.
Then you will use the knife to spread it on one of the pieces of bread.
Then you will go.
"When you finish spreading the peanut butter , you will go and wash the knife off."
Then you will open your jar of jelly.
It is probably going to be a twist top as well.
So you are going to twist it.
Then you will put the top back on.
You will put your two pieces of bread together so that the peanut butter and the jelly are both on the inside.
You have a sandwich.
At least the jelly is going to be in the refrigerator.
So the kid is playing soccer.
The soccer ball smashes into a window.
His dad sees it and gets really mad or surprised.
He is looking out of the busted window and down at the boy.
It looks to me like a kid's about to go outside.
But mother says.
You forgot your umbrella.
It is probably going to rain.
He says.
His mother's looking down at him disapprovingly knowing that he got his clothes all wet when she told him to take the umbrella.
This time he takes the umbrella.
He leaves and goes wherever he was going to go.
I suppose school because he is got a backpack.
So a girl is riding a tricycle when she sees a cat stuck up in the tree.
She calls her father to come.
The cat ran up the tree because the dog was barking at it.
It ran up the tree because the dog was barking at it.
The little girl was riding her tricycle and sees the cat stuck up the tree.
She calls her father and asks him to come try to get the cat down.
But the ladder falls and he gets stuck.
So then they hafta call the fire department to get him down.
"To begin with , it appears as though cinderella's mother has died."
Her father marries a very mean looking woman who has two very ugly sneaky looking girls and a mean cat.
There is never any more mention of cinderella's father.
So i am assuming he is died.
They turn her into the maid to do all the the household work chores and everything.
"So then the king is throwing a ball because i presume he wants to find a beautiful attractive young woman to be his son's wife , the prince."
Cinderella's stepsisters were invited bebecause all the young women in the kingdom were invited.
Cinderella wants to go.
But they say.
No you cannot go.
So her mice friends help make her a dress.
I think it is pink and white.
Then her stepsisters get so jealous when they see her in it that they tear off her jade necklace and destroy her dress.
But then cinderella's fairy godmother comes and makes her a beautiful pretty white dress.
So she goes to the ball.
She is got these nice glass slippers.
She goes to the ball.
"The prince sees her , falls madly in love with her."
But then her two stepsisters see her at the ball.
She gets scared.
So she runs away.
She runs off the steps while the prince is calling for her to get back.
She comes back.
It seems as though her stepmother has seen her coming back from the ball in her dress.
Then the prince comes by with his people to help him or whatever.
But the shoe will not fit on cinderella's stepsisters' feet.
They will only fit on cinderella's foot.
So the prince has found out that it is truly cinderella.
They lived happily.
They get married and live happily ever after.
As if you have never made one before?
In this should i assume that you are not very bright?
So you get a butter knife.
You get a jar of peanut butter.
You also get two loaves of bread and take them out of the bread case.
So then you lay the bread pieces down flat on the counter.
You open the lid to the jar of jelly.
Then you do the same thing with the peanut butter.
You take the peanut butter out with the knife.
Then you stick the two halves together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing each other.
The boy is outside and he is playing soccer.
He is kicking the ball.
Unfortunately he kicks it through his neighbor's window which seems to shock his neighbor who knocks over the vase.
It wakes him up from sleeping.
Or he is watching tv or something.
It shocks him and he is not expecting it.
Then he is looking out the window with the ball to see who the perpetrator is i assume.
The woman's son is refusing an umbrella as mother is saying he may need it for today.
Then of course it starts to rain on him.
He is not appreciating the rain too much.
He comes home.
His mother sees that he is soaking wet.
He comes back for the umbrella i assume.
Then he gets the umbrella and goes his merry way.
It looks like the little girl's cat got up the tree.
Her father or older brother or somebody climbed up the tree to try to rescue the cat.
Then he unfortunately also became stuck.
So they hadta call the fire department out there to rescue both the cat and the father from the tree.
Cinderella seems to be brought to.
Apparently she has no parents or something.
She is brought to her aunt's house or something like that to live.
She is made to be used as a maid.
What she waits on her two cousins and her aunt and takes care of the animals and all that.
"It appears that the her two cousins are invited to a party , a ball of some sort i guess."
She has no clothes.
But the little mice and stuff and birds make a dress for her.
"So she goes to the ball , has a good time , but she hasta be home by midnight."
Around midnight she runs out of there and loses one of her slippers.
She runs back home.
The prince wants to find out who the woman wearing the slipper was because he fell in love with her at the ball.
So he sends his some kind of court personnel around trying to find out who wore the slipper.
Cinderella's foot fit the slipper.
They fell in love again and got married happily ever after.
"To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , first you hafta have all the ingredients."
"You hafta have your loaf of bread of choice , peanut butter , and your jelly or jam of choice."
Then you get your two pieces of bread and lay ththem on the plate.
You open up the the peanut butter and use a spoon to get the peanut butter out of the jar and spread it on one piece of bread.
Then you get another spoon.
You get the jelly out of the jelly jar and put it on the other piece of bread.

He kicked the ball too hard.
It went through the window.
It hit his dad.
It broke the window too.
This kid's going to school.
It is going to rain.
So he walked out and it started raining.
He went back in to his mom.
I told you it was going to rain.
So he got the umbrella.
He went to school.
So the little girl brought her cat out.
It ran away because the dog chased it up the tree.
Then the dad got stuck up the tree trying to get the cat too.
So she hadta call the fire department to come rescue them both.
I do not know the names.
The the guy married the woman.
She had two daughters.
The girls did not like her.
Then she grew up.
She was the hated stepsister.
So there was come a time where there was a ball.
I assume that cinderella got invited.
I am not sure if she was happy when she saw the list.
So cinderella was getting ready but they locked her in a closet.
The mice brought her the key to get out.
She went to her godmother.
She got a little dress and a little carriage to go to the castle.
But she hadta be back by a certain time.
She saw the clock strike whatever midnight.
I think it was.
She was running down the stairs.
She lost the slipper.
Her prince got his servant to go find the woman that was wearing the slipper.
He found cinderella.
They lived happily ever after.
You get two pieces of bread.
I prefer wheat.
I make peanut butter and jelly.
You put peanut butter and the jelly in a bowl.
You mix it up.
Then you put it on both sides.
Why is he playing by himself?
Anyways he is trying to juggle.
He breaks a window.
Dad goes out to kick his ass.
"None of these are going to be happy, by the way."
I do not have any happiness in me right now.
She stole that kid's umbrella.
He is coming home.
He said he did not want it.
Dog chases the cat up the tree.
The man goes to get the cat.
His evil daughter removes the ladder.
The firemen come and get him.
Her father gets remarried and then disappears dies.
"Her stepmother and stepsisters turn her into a slave basically , worker."
They get invited to a ball.
Then she does not get to go.
She does something with a book.
Some fairy godmother shows up and gets her all the stuff she needs.
She goes to the ball and meets the prince somebody.
They fall in love.
Then she runs away because it is midnight leaving a slipper.
She goes back to her life of of toil.
Then some weird guy shows up for the prince and tries on the shoe.
It fits.
So she gets married.
First you will needta get bread.
Then you will need a knife.
You will need peanut butter and jelly.
Which you then apply it to the bread.
There is your sandwich.
Do you want more details?
One day johnny decided he wanted to go outside and play soccer.
He was having fun until one time he kicked the ball too high.
It broke his neighbor's window.
It hit his neighbor.
However his neighbor did not get mad.
He actually went outside to play with him.
One day jackson was arguing with his mother because he did not want to take his umbrella with him to school.
She begged him and begged him.
All of a sudden it began to rain.
He got upset because it was raining.
Then he came back to his mom.
They argued a little bit more.
Then he decided that the umbrella was the best thing for him.
Then he went outside.
He was prepared for the rain.
He did not get wet anymore.
See one day sarah was playing with her cat.
Her cat climbed up the tree to get away from the dog that was chasing her.
So her neighbor decided that he was going to help her.
He used his ladder to get up the tree.
"But since the dog was chasing the cat , he knocked the ladder over."
So they hadta call the fire department.
The firefighters ended up saving the man and the cat.
One time there was a girl named cinderella.
Her dad married her evil stepmother.
She had two stepsisters.
They treated her pretty bad.
They made her do all the chores.
So even as they got older they treated her differently.
One day there was something about a ball.
Her stepsisters of course were going.
Cinderella wanted to go but they told her that she could not go.
But i mean she still had a dress for the event.
When they saw her wear it they kind of laughed.
So then that night her fairy godmother appeared.
She told her that she would be able to go but she when the clock struck twelve that she hadta leave.
So she got ready for the ball.
She entered the ball.
She danced with prince charming.
Then the clock struck twelve or about to.
Then she hadta run.
So she left her glass slipper.
Prince charming was trying to find out who she was.
So he used his shoe.
He went all around.
Even her stepsisters tried on the shoe but they could not fit it.
So cinderella tried on the shoe.
They lived happily ever after.
Well first i would get whole wheat bread.
I would put it in the toaster oven.
I would get my favorite peanut butter which is jif and my favorite jelly which is welch's strawberry jelly.
I would put.
After it was done being toasted i would get a knife.
I would put it in the peanut butter first.
I would put it on one slice of the toast.
Then i would get put the same knife in the jelly and put the jelly on the other slice of toast.
I would put it together.
I would eat it.
That is how i make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
He got really excited and kicked the ball really hard.
It arced through the air.
"It actually hit the the glass window , the big window that was at the the back of the house."
"Not only did it break the window , it also broke the lamp."
His dad dan was was sitting there and saw it.
"So he picked picked up the ball , looked at the lamp , and then looked out the window and saw that it was little johnny."
That is when the the story ends.
So it looks like little johnny is probably going to hafta mow the yard all the many times damage.
So here we have little little danny.
He is getting ready to to walk to school.
His mother is asking him to take his umbrella along with him.
He is refusing because he is a stubborn little fella.
"As he is getting ready to go, his mom tries to say one more time."
You needta take your umbrella.
He said.
So on his way walking to school it starts to rain.
He realizes.
Starts to rain even harder on his way back home.
So he gets back home.
He is soaked.
His mother you know not wanting to tell him.
I told you so.
He got his umbrella.
So he left and then walked all the way back to school.
Scruffy decided to climb up the tree.
Just like most cats it liked to ignore humans.
So it crawled out the limb and crawled up to way far out.
So she went inside to and told her dad to come and say.
Hey can you help me get the cat down?
So the dad decides that he is going to rescue the cat scruffy by getting the ladder and climbing up there.
"So as he gets the ladder , puts it against the tree , the dog sparky came over and actually knocked the ladder down."
So meanwhile someone hadta call the fire department to come and help because the dad was too far up.
It is he cannot climb down because there is only a few branches.
So the firefighters are on their way to come and save the day.
Not only are they going to save dad but they are also going to save the the little cat scruffy.
He cinderella's mother passed away.
He got remarried to a woman that had two daughters.
But they got married.
So he blended the families.
Meanwhile cinderella's father passed away.
The minute that he passed away the evil stepmother started treating cinderella very poorly.
She would basically give the her daughters anything and everything that they wanted.
So she spoiled them rotten but made cinderella basically be the servant for everyone.
"She would hafta scrub the floors , do the cooking , take care of the sisters."
So he he is trying to think of a way to sort of urge him along to get married.
So he decides to throw a huge ball and invite all of the maidens from the entire kingdom.
So of course the invitations go out to everyone.
Cinderella's stepmother receives one.
It is asking for all of the you know women to ball.
So they want to start getting prepared.
But the stepmother does not want cinderella to go.
So she says she can go but only after she finishes all her chores.
But she overloads her with all of her chores.
But she also hasta help her stepsisters get ready.
So basically she has no time.
"So she while she is doing all of her chores , they are actually helping create her a dress."
Was it one that she had?
I guess it was her mother's.
So they fix it up and make it look you know obviously modern for the time and fix it up.
As she finishes all of her chores she gets in and is very excited because she thinks that she is not going to have time to get ready.
But she puts on the dress and steps out to catch the carriage to go with her stepsisters.
But the the rats and the animals had actually used bits and pieces of her stepsisters' castoffs to make the dress.
"When they saw that , they of course became jealous because they were spoiled rotten and not very nice."
"So they started tearing her dress , the various pieces , off."
So they left her dress in tatters.
They left her in emotional tatters.
So she runs back to her room and is crying.
But at that moment in time she meets her fairy godmother who is well a fairy.
"So she is able to bipity bopity boo and cast spells to make a dress, to make a carriage, to have you know just sort of a very royal type entrance."
"So she goes to the ball , meets prince charming , and they have a wonderful time."
But the spell would only last until midnight.
So as they are dancing the night away she loses track of time.
So she starts to flee the ball.
She hasta get away before midnight or everything goes back to the way it was.
She as she is running away she loses one of her glass slippers which is one of the.
Actually the king's helper who was sort of like one of the prince's friends finds the glass slipper.
Because somehow in all this time of dancing they did not get each other's names.
But they get there.
So the prince goes in search of the the maiden whose foot fits this glass slipper.
They come to cinderella's house.
The stepsisters try to say that it is theirs.
They try to cram their feet into the slipper.
Then one version of the story they start cutting off toes and heels.
But in the children's story they just try to cram their foot in there.
But it does not fit.
But she was not there because the evil stepmother had locked her in her room.
But her animal friends ran up to give her the key.
She comes out.
As the helper is going to help her try on the slipper the stepmother trips him.
So now everyone is sort of distraught because how are they going to figure out where it is?
Cinderella says.
Well i have the other one.
She pulls it out.
It it fits.
They get married.
They live happily ever after while the stepfamily loses everything and is sort of just you know sinisters and terrible people for the rest of their lives.
"So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need bread , peanut butter , and jelly."
"Depending on how hungry you are you want to start out with two slices , maybe even more."
So you have put out a plate.
"Use a either knife or a spoon, whatever suits your fancy."
You may want to clean off the spoon or you can just roll with it.
Then you put the the two pieces together.
Put everything away because you want to be nice and neat and tidy.
Then lo and behold you have a wonderful sandwich that you could enjoy.
Well cinderella's dad married what is now her stepmom who had two daughters.
So she had two stepsisters.
He passed away.
So she was left with the stepmom.
The stepmom was evil and made her do all the chores.
The stepsisters did not hafta do anything.
One night the prince in the kingdom was having a ball and because he needs to find a princess.
The stepsisters were going with the stepmother.
But cinderella was not allowed to go because she hadta do her chores.
So she had the magic mice that came and made her this beautiful dress.
But it got ruined by the cat or something.
So she cried because she could not go to the ball anymore.
Then her fairy godmother appeared and made her this wonderful dress and turned a pumpkin into a carriage and all of her mice into horses and took her to the ball.
But she hadta be home by midnight because the spell would be broken.
While she was at the ball she met the prince.
They danced all night.
They fell in love.
But she hadta leave at midnight.
When she was leaving she left her glass slipper on the stairs.
The prince wanted to try and find her.
So he demanded his servant person to take the glass slipper and try it on all of the girls in the kingdom.
When they came to cinderella's house her stepmom locked her up in a tower or her room or something.
The prince could not find anyone who fit the glass slipper.
Somehow she got out of the room.
I think the mice got the key or something and got her out of her room.
When she went downstairs to try on the shoe i remember the slipper broke.
But she had the other slipper and tried it on.
It fit.
Then she met her prince.
They lived happily ever after.
It looks like a boy was playing soccer.
He kicked the ball.
It hit the window of a building by his house or something.
It broke through the window.
The dad was sitting inside and saw the ball.
It went through the window.
Now he is looking out the window probably about to yell at his son or the boy who kicked it.
I would grab two slices of bread.
On one slice i would spread peanut butter with a knife.
On the other slice i would spread jelly evenly.
Then you put them together.
It looks like this little girl's cat climbed up the tree.
She wants the cat to come down.
It looks like maybe the dad or someone older climbs the tree to try to get the cat but it looks like he is scared.
So they called the fire department.
They are coming with a ladder to rescue the man and the kitten down.
The dogs trying to climb up the tree to get to people that are stuck up there.
So maybe he tried to climb up the ladder.
It fell when he was climbing up there.
So that is why he is stuck.
It looks like a little boy's about to go to school.
His mom wants him to bring an umbrella with him.
But he does not want to take the umbrella.
So he makes his mom keep it.
When he goes outside it starts raining.
It starts raining heavier.
So he runs back home.
His mom's upset because he is soaking wet.
Then he decides to leave the house with the umbrella to stay dry.
Well there is a little boy and he is playing soccer.
I guess he kicked it a little too hard.
It hit the neighbor's window and went through the window.
Okay so let us say it is his dad now.
So and then at the end of the story the dad gets up and looks out the window to see what happened.
Well it looks like the mom is telling her son that he should use an umbrella.
Then the son does not want to use it.
He is outside and it starts raining.
So he runs back home all wet.
I told you so.
Then in the last picture he is using the umbrella.
She is trying to get it down.
Somebody wants to help her.
So when they are going up in the tree the ladder falls.
Now the grownup is stuck in the tree.
So it starts off with cinderella.
I do not know if that is her actual name.
I do not think it is.
Her dad remarries.
The stepmom has two daughters of her own.
Then when the dad dies cinderella is left on her own with her stepmom and her two stepsisters.
I know the next picture is her playing with a cat.
Then they get an invitation to the ball and the two stepsisters are really excited.
Cinderella wants to go as well.
So the mice make her a dress with the stepsister's leftover materials.
But when the stepsisters see that her dress is made of all their unwanted clothes they rip it up.
She goes out in the garden.
I cannot think of that word right now.
There we go.
"With horses , a doorman i think."
"She goes to the ball , meets the prince."
They dance.
Then it strikes twelve so she hasta leave.
"In her leaving in a hurry , she loses a shoe."
He goes all around the kingdom to find the girl whose shoe it was.
But cinderella is locked in her room so she cannot try on the shoe.
Then the mice bring the key to her.
She unlocks the door.
But the stepmother tripped the guy who was carrying the shoe.
But luckily cinderella still has one.
They put it on.
It fits.
They live happily ever after.
Ew i hate peanut butter and jelly.
But i would take two pieces of bread.
I think i would do peanut butter first.
I do not know bebecause i never do this.
But i guess you would put the jelly on the other piece of bread.
There is a little boy playing soccer one day.
He kicked the ball.
It went through the window of his neighbor's house.
When it went through the window it knocked over the lamp and broke the lamp and scared the neighbor.
So the neighbor walked over to the window.
He saw the little boy out there.
He was going outside to talk to the little boy about breaking the window and try to see how he could work off repairing the window.
One day it was calling for rain.
So the little boy's mother was going to give him an umbrella.
He said.
I do not need this umbrella.
So he went along his way.
He gets outside and it starts raining.
He is mad because he realizes he should have listened to his mom and taken the umbrella in the first place.
When he makes it back home he is soaking wet.
His mom says.
You should have just listened to me.
So the next day he takes the umbrella when his mom tells him it is going to rain.
He does not get soaking wet.
One day a little girl was riding her bike.
Her cat went up the tree.
It got stuck in the tree.
So she went and found her dad and asked him to get the cat out of the tree.
So he went and got a ladder and put it up to the tree and climbed up.
Once he got up there the ladder fell.
So he got stuck.
"The firefighters hadta come and get him out of the tree , him and the cat."
So they came.
They are going to get him out of the tree and get the cat down for the little girl.
There was a girl.
Her her mother had died when she was younger.
Her father got remarried.
After he got remarried he married this woman who had two daughters.
They were called her evil stepsisters.
She always hadta clean and do all the work.
They never did anything.
One day there was a ball for a prince.
So the sisters were invited and so was cinderella.
"The mom , the evil stepmother , said that she could go as long as she did all of her chores."
"Well when the time came for her to go to the ball, she got ready."
Then the evil stepmother said she could not go.
The evil stepsisters took her jewelery and everything to make themselves look nicer.
"While she was there by herself, a fairy godmother came and made her a dress and turned a pumpkin into a carriage."
She got to go to the ball.
She hadta be back by twelve.
That was the caveat of her going.
She went in.
She danced with the prince.
They had a good time.
"When she went to leave at twelve, she lost her glass slipper."
He searched the whole kingdom and finally came to her.
"After the stepsisters tried it on and did not fit their feet, she tried it on."
It fit her foot.
So her and the prince lived happily ever after.
So i would get the bread.
You hafta open the package that it is in.
You get the peanut butter.
You get a knife.
Get peanut butter on the knife and you spread it on the sandwich.
Then you get the jelly.
You use a knife again.
You spread the jelly on the sandwich.
You have a sandwich.
It appears as though he is kicking a soccer ball.
It goes through the window of a house.
Then the soccer ball knocks over a lamp where a man is sitting on a couch.
Then the man stands up holding the soccer ball.
Looks out the window trying to figure out where it came from.
So we have a mother telling her son he needs to bring an umbrella probably because it is raining outside.
He says.
No i do not need the umbrella.
Then he leaves to walk to school.
It starts raining.
So now he is regretting not bringing he umbrella.
So he is covering his head and running through the rain.
He comes back upset.
I told you to bring the umbrella.
So now he goes back out with an umbrella.
A cat got stuck in a tree.
A little girl found the cat after riding her bike.
The man has now climbed into the tree.
There is a dog barking at him as well.
So they hadta call firefighters to bring a new ladder to get the man and the cat out of the tree.
So cinderella starts with a father and his daughter named cinderella.
The father gets married to a woman who has two daughters as well.
They the family forces her to clean the house.
The father disappears.
I am assuming he dies.
So cinderella befriends the animals of the house.
Then meanwhile at the castle there is a king who wants to hold a ball to marry off his son.
So they send out invitations.
The stepmother gets the invitation.
So she sneaks off and finds a book and decides to sew her own dress with the help of the mice and the other animals.
"But when she puts it on, the evil stepsisters and the stepmother make fun of the dress and rip it off of her."
So she goes and cries at a bench.
This woman appears who is her fairy godmother who grants her wishes to go to the ball by turning all of the animals and mice and the the horse and the dog into horses and a chariot.
But at midnight the spell wears off.
So she goes to the ball.
She dances with the prince.
Then the stepsisters and the stepmother recognize her and get upset and see that she is dancing with the prince.
She realizes she hasta go home.
So she runs off.
So as she is running away her slipper falls off.
The prince takes the slipper.
By the time she gets home the evil stepmother locks her in her room.
The prince and his men are going to search for the girl whose foot fits into the glass slipper.
"When he arrives at the house , the mice give cinderella the key to get out of her room."
She comes downstairs.
The prince's men put the glass slipper on her foot.
It fits.
Then they get married.
They live happily ever after.
So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need two slices of bread.
So first you lay the two pieces of bread out.
You open the jar of peanut butter.
Then you open the jar of jelly.
You take the knife.
"You spread jelly on either on top of the peanut butter on the one slice or you can put it on the other slice, but only on one side."
Then you take the two sides that have the peanut butter and jelly and you put them together so that there is clean bread on the outside.
A little boy was playing soccer in his yard.
He kicked it too hard into the window.
His dad is sitting in the living room where the ball was kicked into.
He did not look very happy about the broken window.
"Before the boy was leaving for school, his mom told him to bring his umbrella bebecause it was sposta rain that day."
Then it did start raining.
He did not look very happy about it.
He came home.
His mom saw that he was all wet.
Then he ended up taking the umbrella back into the rain bebecause he learned his lesson the first time.
"There was a man walking down the street, when a dog started chasing after him."
So he ran and climbed up a tree.
But while he was up there there was a cat that was also running from the dog that climbed the tree and got stuck.
"The cat's owner looked very concerned , is trying to get the cat down."
So the firemen hadta come with their ladders and help both the cat and the man out of the tree.
"Well when cinderella was young, her and her father lived together."
He got remarried.
She had two daughters that came to live with them as well.
The stepmother did not really like cinderella.
She favored the two stepsisters.
She spoiled them constantly.
"Cinderella was forced to be more like a slave in the house, doing all the chores, washing the clothes, things like that."
Then one day the royal kingdom sent a letter to all the houses in the village inviting them to the royal ball.
"The stepmother told cinderella that she could go as well, but she hadta finish all of her chores."
So cinderella got really excited.
She made her own dress.
"Then right before, when the stepsisters and the stepmother were about to leave, they ruined her dress."
They ruined her hair.
So cinderella did not have anything to wear any longer.
While she was crying a fairy godmother appeared.
She gave her a new dress.
She gave her a carriage.
She gave her some glass slippers.
But she told cinderella she hadta be back before the last dong of midnight or all the magic would disappear.
So cinderella went to the ball.
She met the prince.
They danced all night.
Then she started hearing the clock chime for midnight.
So she knew she hadta go.
So she ran out of the castle.
"As she was leaving, she left one of her slippers."
She got into the carriage and went back to her house.
"The next day, the prince was frantically looking for the girl whose slipper it was, knowing that it was his true love."
So he went to all the houses in the kingdom.
He would only marry the girl whose foot fit the slipper.
"So when he got to cinderella's house, the stepmother had figured out it was her at the ball."
She locked cinderella in her room.
"So when they came for the girls to try on the shoe, it did not fit either of the stepsisters."
So cinderella's animal friends found the key to her door and helped her out.
She got to try on the slipper right before the dude was leaving.
It ended up fitting her foot.
Her and the prince lived happily ever after.
You take two pieces of bread.
You put ththem on a plate.
You take a knife.
You put peanut butter on one piece of bread.
You put jelly on the other piece of bread.
Then you bring them together.
Then you cut them in half.
Then you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
"He gets carried away , kicks it too hard."
It lands in his dad's lap after it breaks a lamp.
His dad just kind of catches it and looks out the window to see who it is and realizes it is his son.
So the mom is telling her son that he needs to take an umbrella to school.
No it is not raining.
I do not need an umbrella.
He just leaves without it to go to school.
But then it starts raining.
So he just runs back home.
She is pretty upset with him but still gives him the umbrella and makes him go to school anyways.
So he does that.
So a dog is chasing a cat.
The cat runs up the tree to escape the dog.
So her dad goes up the tree to get the cat for her.
But the ladder falls.
He cannot really get back down.
Neither can he get the cat.
So they end up calling the fire department to come get the dad.
That is kind of where the story leaves off.
We assume that they probably get him and the cat down successfully.
So it is the king who lives in a castle with his daughter cinderella.
"Cinderella's mother , his wife , dies."
He remarries to a woman who brings her own two daughters.
Eventually the king dies.
The woman and her stepdaughters pretty much lock cinderella up.
"They give her a tiny room at a tower in the castle and pretty much make her their servant , really mistreat her."
But then one day she finds out about a ball that is being held by a prince in the neighboring village.
She dresses up for that.
But then the her stepsisters tear her dress.
Somehow her fairy godmother gets there.
I think her fairy godmother just kind of appears.
She does not really summon her in any way.
She goes to the ball with that.
But one of the stipulations her fairy godmother gave her was that it would all end at midnight.
She rushes out to leave and go back to her home.
One of her slippers falls off.
But she just leaves it there.
So she gets back home.
I guess does not really think much of it.
But the prince who really liked her finds the slipper and decides to have all the women in the area try the slipper on to see which one fits.
She just helps them out.
"They tell her about that or something , maybe summon the prince there."
Then they get married and live happily ever after.
"So you just get two slices of bread , peanut butter , and jelly."
You undo the jar for the peanut butter.
You undo the jar of jelly.
Get a scoop or two depending on how much you need.
Then you put the part of the one bread that has the peanut butter on it on top of the part of the other slice of bread that has the jelly on it.
Then you can cut off the crust if you want or cut it in half.
But it is done then.
Cinderella's father married a wealthy lady in the community.
She eventually her father died leaving cinderella with the stepmother and two stepsisters.
They did not treat her very well and used her pretty much as her their servant in the household.
She dreamed of being able to escape her situation and being able to be apart of the whole community.
"She as they worked her and worked her she never really had any free time , never had the freedom to do what she wanted to."
Eventually the king wanted to find a wife for his son.
So he throws a ball.
Everyone in the kingdom is invited to the ball.
Cinderella's stepsisters and stepmother are invited.
They all are getting ready to go.
She is also making preparations to go.
"Except then right as they are getting ready to leave , the her stepmother and stepsisters tear apart everything that she is done and are not will not let her go with them."
So then her fairy godmother appears and creates a wonderful dress and carriage and horseman and horses and everything for her to be able to go to the ball.
"She goes , meets the prince."
"They dance , fall in love of course in a single evening!"
But then one of the caveats of the fairy godmother's spell is that it ended at midnight.
So then as the clock starts to strike twelve she realizes what time it is and that she is about to turn back into her peasant self.
Her carriage is going to become a pumpkin and such.
"So she just takes off out of the castle , no real explanation."
Loses one of her glass slippers that the fairy godmother has given her in the process.
She makes it all the way back to her house and is enjoying reliving the evening and the memories of it.
Then obviously the prince wants to find this woman that he fell so madly in love with.
Eventually they the duke and arrives at the house of cinderella.
But her stepmother has locked her away in the tower so that she cannot come down and be a part of it.
So the stepsisters are trying to get the shoe on in order to become the queen.
So it is not working not working.
Eventually the duke has decided to give up and is going back to the castle.
In the process he the stepmother also breaks the glass slipper that the duke had been carrying around.
Cinderella eventually makes it out of the tower and comes running downstairs with the glass slipper that she still has.
Shows that it still fits.
Or shows that it fits her.
So the duke takes her to the palace to marry the prince.
She becomes princess.
They live happily ever after.
Well we have a nice little country scene.
That it appears what how it started is this little girl's cat ran up into this tree.
She was riding her bicycle.
I guess the cat was playing with her.
Cat goes up into the tree.
We will say it is her dad.
Then this dog decides he is not happy about that.
Has somebody treed.
I do not think he really cares who.
There is i guess that the dog had probably also knocked this ladder over that the man useta climb up into the tree.
Then because now everybody is stuck in the tree the fire department has been called for them to come and rescue to help the little girl get the cat out of the tree and then to help the man get out of the tree without getting attacked by this dog.
So we will assume that all of this worked out nicely and everybody came down safe and sound.
The cat is rescued.
The firemen have sufficiently done their duty.
So this little boy is getting ready to leave for school.
His mother has clearly checked the weather channel and is pretty sure that it is the weather's going to be bad.
Then he he denies it.
As he is walking to school it starts to rain.
He is getting a little wet but it is no big deal.
So he is getting quite soaked.
Walks back into his house soaking wet at which point his mother says.
I told you so.
So in this one there is a guy kicking a soccer ball playing in his yard.
"As he is playing , kicks it a little too hard and knocks it through a window in a house."
As when it goes through the window it knocks over a lamp and scares the guy sitting on the couch.
Then the guy that was inside has the soccer ball and is probably not happy with the kid who just kicked it through his window.
That he is going to hafta replace the window and the lamp.
First thing is you go and collect the peanut butter and the bread from the pantry.
Then you will take two pieces of bread out of the bread bag.
You will take the knife to get peanut butter out of the jar.
Then you will take the jelly and do the same thing where you use a knife to get it out of the jar and to spread it on the piece of bread.
Well looks like it starts out with a kid.
Should i say.
When he got home he was so excited because he scored a few goals.
He decided to keep practicing.
He kicked a soccer ball.
It went through the window and hit his dad on the knee.
His dad realized it was him and grounded him.
Well looks like john wanted to borrow his mom's umbrella.
But his mom would not let him.
Or his mom tried to give him an umbrella but he did not accept the umbrella.
Then he walked to school.
It was raining.
He got really wet.
He was upset and realized he should have listened to his mom.
So the next day he brought an umbrella to school.
So a family's cat got stuck up in a tree.
The dad wanted to go up and try to get the cat.
So they ended up having to call the fire department to try to get the dad and the cat out of the tree.
She had two stepsisters and a mom.
She was really mistreated.
She was basically treated like the house slave or whatever.
She would do everything for ththem.
So she developed relationships with like the animals and stuff around their property or whatever.
Then eventually she meets this fairy godmother that grants her wish to go this ball or something of that sort.
She meets a prince who and has a great night with him and everything and loses one of her slippers.
"Then at the end of the story, the prince comes back with the slippers."
The two evil stepsisters are trying to think.
Oh might the slipper might fit me.
But then it ends up fitting cinderella.
Basically her dreams come true.
I would get out the bread first.
Then i would put the peanut butter on the left side.
Once upon a time there was a boy playing with a soccer ball outside.
But he kicked it too hard and too far.
"It crashed through his neighbor's window, hit the lamp, knocked it over."
The man caught it and angrily yelled out the window at the boy.
So the mother suggested to to get her young son to take an umbrella with him as he went to school.
But he did not want to take the umbrella.
He decided to go to school anyways.
So he found himself very wet and ended up having to run back home to his mother to take the umbrella with him to school anyways.
"The dad, thinking that he could be macho man, decided to go up into the tree with his ladder and get the cat."
But the dog knocked over the ladder.
So the man got stuck in the tree.
So when cinderella was a young girl her mother died.
Her father decided that he needed to get remarried so that cinderella would have a mother.
But he married a very evil woman.
When her father left cinderella with her new stepmother and two stepsisters they made cinderella do all of the chores around the house.
Cinderella would look outside the window and see the castle and dream about living there some day.
But i mean who is she?
So she did not think that that would ever happen.
"Then one day, they received an invitation stating like about a ball."
But cinderella could not go.
Still cinderella made a dress to prepare to go to the ball.
"But when her stepmother and stepsisters found out , they tore up the dress because they knew that cinderella was more beautiful, and it would capture the prince's attention."
So cinderella was left at home without a dress while her stepmother and stepsisters went to the ball.
But then along came her fairy godmother who made a dress for her so cinderella could go to the ball.
"But she hadta be home by midnight because the fairy tale would end at midnight, and her dress would go being the shreds that her stepsisters made out of it."
So she goes to the ball.
She meets the prince.
They get along very nicely.
But then she hasta run home as the clock struck midnight.
In a hurry she ended up leaving one of her slippers glass slippers behind.
The prince found this and decided to track her down.
So he took the glass slipper all throughout the kingdom.
None of the girls' feet would fit into the glass slipper until he came across cinderella.
So they decided to get married and live happily ever after.
Well you take two pieces of bread.
You put some peanut butter on each slice.
Then you put some jelly in the middle.
You can also add bananas if you like.
Then you put the two pieces of bread together and eat it.
A boy was playing soccer in his yard when he accidently kicked the ball through his dad's window.
His dad was sitting in the living room when the ball came in and hit a lamp.
His father looked outside and immediately knew who did it because he was the only one standing there.
A woman told her son to carry an umbrella to school with him because it was going to rain.
He said he did not need it.
He said goodbye and went to school.
But on the way to school he noticed that it started raining.
However he did not turn back to go back to his house until it started pouring.
"When he got home, his mother was angry because he was wet."
She also said.
I told you so.
Then he hadta change clothes and was sent back to school with the umbrella.
A little girl's cat saw a bird in a tree and climbed the tree to get to the bird.
However the cat got stuck in the tree.
The little girl called the man over with his dog to come and get the cat out of the tree.
So when he set up the ladder his dog got excited about the cat in the tree and knocked the ladder over which prompted the little girl to call the fire department to come get the man and the cat out of the tree.
"Once upon a time, a man whose wife had died a long time ago and his daughter lived alone until the man met an a woman with two daughters."
They moved in.
He was married.
Then he died.
The stepmother of the man's daughter adopted the daughter but did not love her as much as she loved her own children.
So she made cinderella.
She lived in the house and cleaned up after the stepsisters and the stepmother who had a cat named lucifer.
Cinderella was friends with the mice and the birds and the horse and a dog that they all had on the property.
One day the kingdom's message boy or servant delivered an invitation for the prince's ball which was put on by his father in order to find the prince a wife.
Every eligible girl in the kingdom was invited.
So cinderella made her dress out of the sash and necklaces and stuff that she borrowed from her stepsisters.
"But when she came down the night of the ball, her stepsisters took it all back and ruined her dress."
Then the stepmother gave her a list of chores to do before she could go to the ball.
But of course they took forever so she did not think she was going to be able to go.
So she was crying.
Then her fairy godmother came and created her a dress and a coach and a bunch of horses and a little groomsman guy who tells the horses where to go.
Said she had until midnight.
So she went to the ball.
The stepsisters did not know who she was.
But she danced with the prince all night.
Right as the clock struck midnight she was running away.
Her shoe fell off on the steps.
He kept it.
Then she went home.
Then the next day the kingdom's message boy went around to all of the houses to find out who fit the glass slipper.
When the stepmother found out that this was going to happen she locked cinderella in the very top tower of their house.
The mice stole the key out of the stepmother's pocket and got it all the way up the stairs and let cinderella out.
It did not fit.
"So right as he was about to leave , cinderella came rushing down the stairs."
He was about to try it on her foot but the stepmother tripped the guy.
It broke the shoe.
Wait i have the other one.
She married the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
"First you hafta gather two slices of bread, a knife, and a spoon and a plate, a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly."
You take one slice of bread.
You put peanut butter on one side using the knife.
Then you set that down and pick up the next slice of bread.
You put jelly on a single side with the spoon.
Then you take the two pieces of bread with the peanut butter and the jelly on the inside.
You put them together.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Well little billy was playing soccer in his backyard.
He aggressively kicked the ball up in the air.
It went over into his neighbor's house and smashed the window.

As he walks to school it begins to rain.
He runs home through the rain in the puddles and gets incredibly wet.

So then she gave him the umbrella back.
He walked to school with it.
A little girl's cat was caught up a tree.
"When a man was walking by, he decided to go and help to get the cat out of the tree."

So eventually the the father passed away.
The daughters and the mother just kind of ran cinderella's life.
They made her their servant in a nutshell.
Cinderella did everything that she was asked to even though she did not like it.
But she always dreamed of being a princess at the castle.
Or i think it was the duke.
If i recall.
He is made him in charge of getting the son to be married.
So they decided to put on a ball.
So the invitations are sent out.
Cinderella gets one as as well do the the evil stepsisters.
The stepsisters are going to go.
Cinderella asked if she can go.
The stepmother says that she can but that she hasta do all of her chores and find a dress.
"So cinderella's animal friends make her a dress , the birds and the mice."
"Then when she gets all presentable and she goes downstairs to leave, they tear her dress up and tell her that she cannot go."
So then they leave.
Her fairy godmother shows up out of nowhere and says that she will give her all the things that she needs.
"But it expires at midnight , the blessing."
So cinderella gets a nice dress and a carriage.
The mice are turned into her guards or whatever.
She is brought to the castle and to the ball.
"The prince immediately rushes to her, much to the hatred of the stepsisters and mother."
You know they have a good time.
They fall in love.
But the it hits midnight.
So all of her stuff starts disintegrating.
"The advisor to the prince, the general or duke chases after her."
But she gets away.
"But she drops the slipper, one of her shoes."
Everything else goes away except for her shoes.
So she is left with one.
They have one.
So the prince says that he wants to.
She goes back home.
The prince says that he wants to find her.
So he decides to try the shoe on everyone.
So eventually at some point he gets to their house.
The stepsisters cannot fit in it.
The stepmother does not fit in it.
So they try cinderella.
It is a match made in heaven.
Place them on a plate so one side's facing up on each one.
Then you are going to want to take a knife.
"Then spread it across one of the pieces of bread, gently so that it is evenly dispersed throughout the slice of bread."
Next you are going to want to.
Well you apply as much as you need or you feel that you need.
Then you want to take the jelly and do the same thing.
"Except and then you put in on there, on top of the peanut butter."
However much you want.
"Then you take the other slice of bread and you put it on top of the jelly, making a sandwich."

You know sometimes when you are practicing some soccer things get a little out of hand.
So his soccer ball went through the glass window of his neighbor mister willis who is in the middle of watching tv just relaxing.

So there was no escaping that.
"So then he picks up the ball, looks outside, and sees johnathan who is then running away because he realizes that he made a terrible mistake against mister willis."
He walks to school every day.
His mom said.
You know james you should take your umbrella.
I really think you should take your umbrella.
It is going to be fine.
I am not going to take the umbrella.
He probably would not say it with that vernacular because he is like seven.

All his books get wet in his backpack.
He gets home.

So the man got scared and switched his pace from walking to a fullon sprint.
Way of how fight or flight works he climbs up a tree and gets in a branch to get away from the dog.
This is just a little feral cat that goes around in the neighborhood.
So it climbed up the tree.

That is how she gets her name cinderella.
Cinderella you know lives within eye shot of the castle and always dreams of going to a ball there.
Conveniently the king tells his son the prince that he wants him to find a wife because they are going to need someone else for the throne.
Well i guess we will have this grand ball.
Whoever i meet there and i fall for is who i will end up marrying.
So cinderella had been working on this ball gown because they were had received a letter that there was going to be this ball.

And then she finds her way to the ball.
The grandmother does say.
"But the condition, you can have this but only until midnight."
You hafta get home by midnight.
Otherwise all this stuff will go back to what it was originally.
So cinderella ends up going to the ball.
The prince sees her and is like.
I have never seen her.
I am bummed with all these other ladies that are at this ball.
So they end up dancing all night.
So cinderella realizes just before midnight that she hasta get out.

So she runs down the steps.
"But one of shoes falls off, which she does not care because she just hasta get out of te because she does not want reputation tainted."

So they spent the whole night dancing together and just having a wonderful time.
Then the prince was trying to get to know her a little bit better.
Then the she looked up and saw the clock.
So she just took off running.
She did not want the prince to see her in her torn clothes and everything.
As she was running away she lost one of her glass slippers.
Well she got to the stagecoach.
They get out of the palace grounds.
Then right after they get out of the palace grounds the horses turn back into mice.
The stagemen turn back into the mice.
So she is sitting there in her torn dress.
But she still has one glass slipper.
So she goes back to the house.
He found the love of his life.
Then she just ran off.
So he goes around the kingdom looking for her.
He is having every girl he sees try on this glass slipper bebecause he knows that the one that it fits is the one that he loves.
So he he is making his way around the kingdom.
He gets to cinderella's house.
Well cinderella is doing chores.
Her her stepsisters try on the slippers.
It it just does not work.
They are both have massive feet.
So it really did not work for ththem.
Well that is that is all the girls we have here.
You should leave.
Then he sees cinderella.
So he has her try on the slipper.
So the prince takes cinderella away from her evil stepmom and stepsisters back to the palace.
They get married.
They live happily ever after.

But you get a nice scoop of jam or jelly on there.
You put it on the bread.
You smear it out.
Then you take and you put the two halves together.
Then you can cut it into half or you can cut it into fourths cutting.
Then you got yourself a nice p b and j.
Can i start?
So a little boy kicks a soccer ball into a window of a neighbor.
It went through the window and almost hit the guy that was sitting inside.
The guy stood up and looked out who hit the ball.
I guess he wants to return it.
The mom suggests that the boy should take his umbrella.
But he refuses.
So it rains.
He is left without an an umbrella.
He hasta cover his head and walk through the rain.
Then the next time it rains he has a umbrella.
So there is a girl.
She has a kitten.
Somehow the kitten gets stuck on top of the tree.
So her father tries to rescue the kitten.
But he gets stuck as well.
So the little girl calls the the firemen and nineoneone.
The firemen come.
They are about to you know hook the ladder to the tree in order to rescue both of them.
So cinderella arrives at this house.
When she arrives she notices that you know the stepsisters and then the mother is not you know excited about her being there.
So eventually their mother and the stepsisters they get a invitation to a ball.
Cinderella sees this palace across her room.
She you know reads a book and you know sees this lovely dress.
One day the her fairy godmother kind of gives her this special wish of shoes glass slippers and a beautiful dress.
While her her stepsisters went to meet the prince.
She goes to the ball.
She dances with the prince.
He likes her.
But she loses her glass slipper.
The stepsisters try to steal it.
She finds it.
Then she lives happily ever after.
So you would go to where ever your bread is.
So let us just say your bread is in the refrigerator.
You get out the pack of bread.
You get out the peanut butter and a knife.
You set them down.
You get a plate.
You put two slices of bread on there laying side by side.
You open the peanut butter top.
You scoop up some peanut butter with the knife and spread it completely this side to one side.
So you would get the the jelly and another knife and scoop it in there.
Then you can put it on top of the peanut butter.
Then you can eat it.
So the little kid wanted to go play outside.
He decided to play soccer.
So he punts the ball up in the air and accidently kicks it into the window of his neighbor's house.
His neighbor being a adult male gets angry and confronts the little kid and tells him to not do it ever again.
So the little kid is going to go to school.
His mother offers him an umbrella because she thinks it will rain.
But he says he does not need it.
So he leaves for school.
As he is walking it starts to pour.
He gets upset and runs back home crying.
Then his mom tells him “i told you so” and gives him the umbrella.
He gets the umbrella walks to school and does not get wet with the umbrella.
Then he gets to school all dry.
There is a little girl that owns a cat.
She told her dad to help her get the cat.
So her dad climbs the tree.
But as he does this he gets stuck up in the top branch and does not save the cat.
So he tells his his daughter to call the fire department.
So they arrive at the scene.
Then his dog comes barking up at the tree.
Meanwhile there is a bird on the other branch.
The firefighters are running towards the tree to save them.
Her she lives in a house with some of her sisters and her stepmom and her dad.
She cleans and gets along with all of the pets and all the animals and things.
They think they are beautiful and that cinderella is ugly.
I think her dad wanted her to get married and find a man.
Meanwhile all this is happening the king of where they are living in is worried that his son needs to find a princess or a wife.
So he holds this ball this party.
So the prince arrives at cinderella's house one day and asks cinderella to be his his princess.
His her sisters get angry because they wanted to be the princess.
So they kind of terrorize cinderella.
But then a magical lady appears and makes cinderella all beautiful and gives her a dress and horses and a carriage to go to this party.
Then they go to the ball.
They have a good time.
So she runs down the steps and loses her glass shoe.
The prince finds it.
So he goes the day party or whenever party and tries to find whoever is feet the shoe fits in.
It fits her foot.
They live happily ever after.
So you get two pieces of bread.
It could be white bread or wheat bread or whatever you want.
Then you buy some peanut butter.
There is crunchy.
There is creamy stuff.
You spread the peanut butter on both sides of both pieces of bread.
Then you get jelly.
Which is what i use.
But you know you can spread it as well.
I i usually just spread it on one side.
Then you close up the the sandwich.
I usually cut it in half.
He kicked the ball too hard.
It hit his neighbor's window.
It crashed through the window and landed right next to a neighbor who was sitting there watching tv and knocked over his lamp.
The neighbor picked up the ball and looked out the window to yell at out there.
But the boy had already ran away.
So little boy was getting ready for his first day of school.
His mom insisted that he take an umbrella.
He said “no thank you” and left.
Even though she really wanted him to take it.
As soon as he got outside it started to rain.
He realized he would made a big mistake and ran all the way home through all these puddles.
He got home and was soaking wet.
There they stood there was a cat in a tree.
So a neighborly man tried to come help her.
He brought his ladder but ended up getting stuck in the tree himself when the ladder fell down.
I guess there was a dog barking at him too.
I did not take that into consideration.
Then he told her to go call the fire department.
So they are coming in to save the man and get the cat out of the tree as well.
So it starts with cinderella's dad marries.
I guess her mom dies or something.
Her dad marries this woman who has two daughters of her own.
They start a new family.
But then her dad passes away.
The mother ends up being extremely evil.
Then she grows up.
She becomes the servant girl of the house.
She cooks for them and cleans for them.
Her only friends are the animals which she talks to.
One day in the kingdom the king basically says his son needs to get married.
He wants all of the eligible bachelorettes in the kingdom to come to this ball.
So he comes around giving invitations to all of the families.
The evil stepmother gets the invitation is reading it.
Cinderella wants to go.
She goes up.
And she goes into a trunk.
I think it was her mother's clothes or something like that.
She finds this old gown.
I know all of her little bird friends and stuff help her put together this really beautiful outfit.
So later when the ball comes around everyone is ready to go.
She comes down.
They basically tear up her dress.
They say she is not allowed to go.
"You know in some versions they give her a lot of chores to do, and say."
So they are basically make it so she cannot go.
She goes outside.
Her fairy godmother appears.
So she goes to the ball.
Of course the prince sees her.
They dance.
They are having a great time.
She realizes the clock is about to strike twelve.
That was the time for the magic was it was going to wear off.
So she is running down the steps and leaves her one glass slipper that the royal butler or duke or whatever he is picks up as she is running out.
But she still has one of them.
So she goes home.
Of course i needta find her.
So that is all they have.
The only clue they have is that glass slipper.
So they go around house to house.
I know a different version of the story.
The mom tries to stop her from being found out.
She sometimes she locked her in her room.
I think in the story book version she just tries to trip the guy holding it so it breaks.
But basically end of the story is they find cinderella.
The the slipper fits perfectly.
So you know it is a perfect match.
The prince and cinderella get married and live happily ever after.
Well first you need three.
Well you need bread.
You need peanut butter.
You need a knife and a surface to make it on.
You take the two pieces of bread.
You put them down.
With your knife peanut butter on one side coating the inner of one side of bread.
Then you do the same thing with the jelly on the other side.
Then you put the two pieces of bread so together so the peanut butter and jelly are touching each other.
Then you have a sandwich.
Well first there was a little boy.
He kicked the ball really hard.
It went through a window and broke it.
The soccer ball went through the window and knocked over the lamp.
It looks like the guy's face is very surprised.
He takes the soccer ball and looks out the window and is probably going to go talk to the boy.
The little boy shakes his hand and says.
No i do not want the umbrella.
It starts to rain.
It rains on him and gets him all wet.
He is going through the puddles.
It is raining really hard.
"He is trying to cover his head, probably wishing he had the umbrella."
"When he gets back home, mom has a very stern look on her face."
The kid is soaking wet.
Looks like he is probably learning a lesson to listen to what mom says.
So the next time he goes out he carries his umbrella and learns his lesson.
Well it looks like two things are happening at the beginning.
It looks like the cat got stuck in a tree.
A dog ran a man up the tree.
They are both stuck.
Somebody called the fire department.
So the little girl can get her cat down.
So they can maybe get the man down.
It looks like before they called the firemen they tried to maybe use a ladder.
But it looks like it was too short.
After they called the firemen the firemen came in.
They are going to get the cat down and get the the man down who was run up by the dog.
Everyone will go home and be happy.
The maybe the cat man will learn their lesson not to climb the trees anymore.
Something happened to her mother.
I her mother died.
Her father married a a new wife who had two daughters.
She moved in with them.
They were referred to as her ugly stepsisters.
They did not welcome her into the home.
Cinderella hadta do all the chores around the house.
So she made friends with all the animals around the house and learned to enjoy life that way.
One day they got a notice from the the royal castle that there was going to be a ball.
That the prince needed to find a significant other.
There was going to be a royal ball.
But it turns out that cinderella was not going to get to go to the ball.
The stepmother made it so that she had chores and and things to do and was not going to be able to go.
She also did not have anything to wear.
So she got all of her chores done.
"All the animals, the mice and all the animals, helped make her a dress to wear to the ball."
She got all ready to wear the dress.
The ugly stepsisters tore it up and ripped all of her things off.
And she did not have anything to wear.
So she was not going to get to go to the ball.
Suddenly appeared a fairy godmother who used her magic wand to make cinderella a beautiful ball gown.
And she had a horse and a carriage to ride to to the ball in.
She went to the royal ball and and danced with the prince.
He fell in love with her.
They were having their night of romance.
And suddenly she remembered that her fairy godmother told her when the clock strikes twelve the spell would be broken.
She would lose her fancy dress.
Then her carriage would turn back into a pumpkin.
Her clothes would go back to her normal raggedy clothes.
So she ran off and left the prince.
But when she ran off one of her.
She had on silver slippers glass slippers.
She stepped out of one and left ththem on the the stairway going down from the castle.
So she went back home.
The spell broke.
Everything turned back to normal.
She went on about her business.
But she still had one glass slipper and then one left behind.
So again the the palace sent out a notice to everybody in the community that the prince was going to try to find his love.
He was going to go around to all the houses that had young women and have them try on the glass slipper to find his his love and see who it was that left that slipper behind.
Well the the stepmother locked cinderella in her room.
The ugly stepmothers tried to.
When the people came by to for the girls in that house to try on the slippers the stepmother locked cinderella in her room.
So she could not do it.
The ugly stepdaughters tried to get their feet in the shoes.
But they did not work.
Cinderella finally made it out and had the other glass slipper on in her hand.
Her foot fit perfectly into the slipper.
Her and the prince lived happily ever after.
If you are going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first out your bread your peanut butter a jar of jelly and i get a knife and a spoon.
You are going to take out two pieces of bread.
Then you take your knife and put it in the peanut butter.
Then you are going to spread it around one piece of bread.
Then you close the sandwich and eat it.
So there was the little boy.
He was playing soccer in his back yard.
He kicked a soccer ball really hard and fast.
Then it crashed through the next door neighbor's window and broke through the window.
The neighbor caught the soccer ball and looked outside.
So there was a little boy off on his way to school.
His mom's trying to hand him an umbrella.
He did not want the umbrella.
So he ended up walking outside getting wet in the rain and hadta come back for his umbrella.
There is a lot of things going on here.
So there was a cat that climbed up this tree.
In response there is a guy who tried to catch the cat for this little girl.
The fire department hadta end up coming to rescue him to get him and the cat down.
There was also a dog that was barking.
I thought.
Well i guess i should add the fact that there was a ladder that the guy tried to get up with.
It fell down.
So there was this girl named cinderella.
She had this little town by this magic kingdom.
She had two stepsisters and a stepmother who were very mean to her.
She hadta mop and clean and clean up the house all the time.
There was announcement of a ball for the prince to be married.
So she she wanted to go to that.
However she had no way of getting there really because her stepsisters did not want her to go.
"She ended up recruiting some friends, like her mice and dog friends, to make the dress for her."
So she ended up getting the dress ready and everything to go to the ball.
Ends up that the stepsisters found out.
They got mad and cut her dress apart.
She ended up crying and you know upset.
So her fairy godmother came along.
Told her she hadta be back by midnight or else she would lose all of her dresses and all of that.
So she went to the ball.
She met the prince.
In the weeks preceding that the prince hadta go around and figure out who was this girl her slipper bebecause he was in love with her.
The stepsisters tried and the stepmom tried to like prevent that.
But it did not end up working.
She ended up marrying the prince living happily ever after.
So you get your two pieces of bread.
Whatever type you want.
Whole wheat if you want to be healthy.
White if you are just you know regular peanut butter sandwich.
You butter and jelly out.
I usually use a spoon for my jelly.
So i take a spoon and scoop up the jelly and spread it on one piece of the bread.
Then i take the knife and scoop in the peanut butter and spread it on the other side of the bread.
Then you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
So there was this boy.
He liked to play soccer.
He kicked the ball so hard that he kicked it into his neighbor's window.
The he broke the window.
The ball went through the window and hit the lamp that was sitting on the coffee table next to the couch.
Unfortunately his neighbor was sitting on the couch so it startled him.
He jumped up and looked out the window and grabbed the ball.
He saw his neighbor standing outside looking really upset.
So there was a little boy.
His mom told him that it was going to rain.
It is not going to rain.
I do not need an umbrella.
So i am not going to take it.
So she tried to give it to him.
But he insisted that it was not going to rain.
So he got outside.
It is raining.
So on the way home that day it was still raining.
When he got back in the house his mom was upset with him because he would been walking in the rain.
He was soaking wet.
I told you to take an umbrella.
But you did not listen.
So the next day when she told him to take an umbrella he took it.
He did not get wet.
So there was a dog.
He was chasing a cat.
The cat belonged to a little girl.
So the cat was trying to get away from the dog.
It ran into a tree.
The girl was saying.
I need someone to get my cat out of the tree.
So a man that was walking by got his ladder.
He tried to climb up and get the cat.
But the dog knocked the ladder down.
So then he could not get down either.
So she called the fire department.
They came and helped get the man down and the cat.
So there was a little girl named cinderella.
She lived with her dad.
So her dad remarried another lady.
The lady had two daughters.
So they became her stepmother and her stepsisters.
Well her dad dies.
So she is left with her stepmom and stepsisters.
They made her clean up and be their maid and do all the dirty stuff in the house.
But she had friends.
So she talked to them.
She would look out her window a lot and look at the kingdom that was far away and just wish that she had a better life than the one that she had.
In the kingdom at that same time the people that were assisting the prince were planning a ball for him because they said that it was time for him to get married.
So they sent out a letter to everyone in the kingdom inviting them to the ball.
Her stepsisters and stepmother were really excited because they thought that they would be one of the ones to marry the prince.
When she heard about it she got excited too.
So she went into her mother's old trunk and found her mom's dress.
Her mice friends helped her fix it up.
She put it on and went downstairs.
But her stepsisters and evil stepmother ripped it up and so she would not be able to go bebecause they are mean.
So she ran outside.
She was crying.
When she was crying her fairy godmother comes and asks her why she is crying.
I am going to take care of it.
So she turns the pumpkin into a carriage for her and gives her this nice new dress and turns her mice friends into these people to help her get to the ball.
She gives her a pair of glass slippers and tells her.
You know have a good time.
But at the stroke of midnight you needta be back home because everything is going to go back to normal.
So she goes to the ball.
He dances with her.
But they are they are talking.
This the clock strikes midnight.
I hafta go.
He tries to get her to stop.
But she knew what was about to happen.
So she leaves.
As she leaving she one of her glass slippers slips off her feet.
She leaves it on the staircase.
She goes back home.
Everything goes back to normal except for the other glass slipper that she was wearing.
So the prince says that he is determined to find her.
He decides that he is going to go to all of the places in the kingdom and have the women try on their the glass slipper that she left because so that he can find her.
So when her stepmother and stepsisters hear about this they locked her up.
So s be one of the people to try on the slipper.
"When they came to the house, one of the people that assists the the prince had the slipper on a pillow."
But the stepmother trips him so that the slipper breaks.
But luckily her mice friends come and give her the key so that she can get out.
She has the other slipper.
So she shows it to the prince and his assistants.
They she puts it on her feet.
Then they take her away.
She lives happily ever after with the prince.
"To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need a plate, two slices of bread, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, and a knife."
So you take the first slice of bread.
You scoop some peanut butter out of the jar with the knife.
Then you take the knife and wash it off if you needta.
Then you put the two slices of bread together.
Can i just name him bob?
Bob went outside to play soccer.
He was just playing around in a field and just decided.
You know what?
I am going to aim for a house.
He aimed for the house.
But he hit the window.
It went through the window and landed into jeremy's lap.
Jeremy looked outside and was like.
Then he saw bob.
But bob ran away.
But his mom stopped him at the door and said.
Jeff you need an umbrella.
First he denied the umbrella but then realized.
You know what mom?
I will take it.
It started raining.
It went from raining to pouring cats and dogs.
He did not have his umbrella.
I do not know why.
But once he got home his mom was like.
I think that is what i named him.
Mom i forgot my umbrella.
So he was going to his friend's house to do homework.
It started raining again.
He pulled him umbrella out and was thankful.
Susie decided to go to the park and play.
She wanted to take her cat with her.
So the cat decided to run up the tree.
"Jeff, he decided."
You know what?
I am going to go and try and help the little cat.
Out of nowhere a dog came.
This scared jeff.
You know what?
I do not want to move bebecause i do not want to fall.
Bebecause if i fall i am going to get attacked by the dog.
Susan is still yelling.
The dog is barking.
So someone saw it and called the firefighters.
I think i would have been better if i have actually seen cinderella.
So a lady she looks really mean.
I guess that is the stepmother.
She came in with two girls.
I am guessing they were her daughter.
A man was inviting them into his home.
He had a little girl which is cinderella.
Then the guy disappeared.
I am going to say he died.
He died or ran away.
The stepmother started treating her bad.
They treated her like like a servant.
She would hafta take them things.
They would call and she would just hafta answer to them.
Well in the picture she seemed really nice with this little grumpy cat.
The mice were trying to run from him.
But she was trying to pet him and be nice and friendly.
Then some guy came in.
She was looking out of a window.
It looked like a palace.
You know what?
I wish i did not live this life.
I wish i could live in the palace.
I guess.
The guy came in.
They looked happy.
So i guess they were getting invited there.
So cinderella got invited too because she started looking for a dress.
She got a pink dress.
When she was on her way out the sisters ripped her necklace off.
I guess they were being mean or jealous bebecause she was pretty or something.
But she went outside and was laying on a horse.
She had a wand.
She got dressed up and went to the party.
She got there dancing with some guy.
She was dancing with the prince.
So i guess she curfew and tried to run home.
But her on her way running down the stairs she lost her shoe.
She did not notice or was too scared to turn around.
But she kept running and got to the house.
I guess let her in before anyone noticed.
I do not think she got yelled at.
But in the end one guy was looking for the person who lost her shoe.
Her sisters were trying it on.
But it did not fit their feet.
They tried it with her foot.
It worked.
I guess the prince found his princess.
They lived happily ever ever after.
So first you hafta be sure you have bread.
I keep my bread on top of the fridge.
So you go to the top of the fridge and grab your whole wheat bread.
You make sure you have a plate laid out.
The two slices of bread just lay them casually on the plate.
Be sure that you have a knife.
See if we have the little peanut butter and jelly that is mixed already in one container it is less work.
So you just gets the knife.
You just scoop it out.
No particular way that you hafta scoop it out.
If you do not want a lot you could just lay it on one piece of bread.
You just spread it out nice and evenly.
Then you put the other bread on top.
You cut the crust off.
You wash the knife.
If we have the peanut butter and jelly in the cabinet or container you just place it back in there.
You are done.
This little delinquent is playing irresponsibly in somebody else's front yard because he has previously broken his own window.
His mom yelled at him.
So history repeats itself.
He kicks the ball through somebody else's front window.
Lands in the dude's lap where he is sitting innocently on his sofa trying to read the newspaper.
He does not have a newspaper.
But it knocks over a lamp which is you know further damage that this little punk is going to hafta pay for.
"The man picks up the ball , goes to the window and looks out."
But the kid has already run off because he has a good understanding of consequences.
So his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he will probably just hit kids with it.
She checked weather dotcom this morning.
It said it was like a twenty percent chance of rain.
So the little kid goes off to school.
His mom holds onto the umbrella.
Lo and behold as he is walking to school it starts to rain.
He is dismayed because not only was he right he also now does not have an umbrella.
So he runs back home.
He frowns at his mother because he is a kid.
He is not allowed to say.
I told you so.
His mother relents and gives an him an umbrella with which to walk to school.
So it is kind of you know immaterial at this point.
You should not hit people with things.
This would not happen.
At which point the cat thought to itself.
I have not been living up to my full potential.
So the cat climbs the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there.
So it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a different branch because he cannot get down.
So he might as well look like he did it on purpose.
At which point the little girl riding by on her tricycle sees the cat and thinks to herself.
That cat needs rescuing because i am nosy.
So she goes.
She reaches for the cat.
It is certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms because it is a cat.
So the girl goes and gets her dad.
The dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree.
He climbs up with the goal of getting the cat.
But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there.
So he goes to climb back down the ladder when the dog notices the cat.
It lives by the school but you know goes to the playground sometimes.
The kids like to pet it.
But it sees the cat.
It goes barking up to the tree.
It knocks over the ladder on accident.
So the man is stuck in the tree even though he could jump.
So he pulls a cell phone out of his pocket.
He looks like an old fashioned kind of guy.
So he calls nineoneone and asks for the fire department to come and bring a ladder to get this cat.
The dispatcher thinks to herself.
Do people really do this in real life?
I thought this was just a movie thing?
But she sends off people from the fire department with a ladder.
They come up with their sirens going because they do not get to do this that often because it is kind of a small community.
People do not tend to set things on fire that much.
So they come running up with the ladder to get the cat.
Cinderella lived with her father.
Presumably her mother died.
I think that is what happened in the original story.
I do not know what disney said.
"Because what is important is that when she was a little girl , little cheerful girl , very nice , her father remarried to this not very nice woman who had two not very nice daughters who had big noses and angry eyes."
Basically i am pretty sure her father died also.
I do not remember that from the movie.
I figure it must have been you know too tragic for kids.
They kill everybody's parents off.
So cinderella at this point is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters and no parental you know oversight that actually cares about her.
"So she grows up as basically the servant , basically the slave of this family."
She does not get paid.
There is a cat named lucifer.
There is a cat named lucifer who belongs to the step family who is always terrorizing her mice friends.
So she hasta protect them.
They are all you know good buddies.
They sing songs together.
The king says to his advisor.
I want my son to get married because he is getting on in years.
He wants a grandkid.
Which does not seem like a very good reason to urge your heir apparent to get married to me.
But the heart wants what it wants.
So the kings decides to throw this enormous ball to which every single eligible maiden in the kingdom will be invited.
By eligible maiden i mean probably over the age of thirteen and not already married.
So the step family and cinderella get the invitation.
They are all psyched because this is great.
One of them could marry the prince.
So leading up to the day of the ball the step daughters get the beautiful gowns.
"Cinderella , her mice and bird buddies make her a dress because they want her to go to the ball also because they are just nice."
So cinderella sees this.
She gets so excited because this means she can go to the ball.
She puts on the dress.
She goes downstairs to meet her step family at the door and then to get into the carriage to off to the ball.
They say to themselves.
They rip her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable so she cannot go to the ball because they are mean.
At this point cinderella's kind of crying to herself.
But also i would probably cry.
If mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it i would cry.
So she is sitting there crying.
All of a sudden her fairy godmother comes.
Why she has a fairy godmother nobody's really sure.
But her fairy godmother comes and says bibity bobity boo.
The pumpkin turns into a carriage.
The dogs turns into horses.
No the dog turns into the coach driver i think.
The mice turn into horses.
Cinderella's rags turn into a beautiful wedding gown.
The fairy godmother says.
Oh i see that you still have these rags on your feet.
I am going to turn them into beautiful glass slippers.
That is why i am pointing it out now.
So cinderella is all set to go to this ball.
Not really but just to her you know everybody bebecause nobody actually cares about her and her life.
The fairy godmother says.
Cinderella you got to get out of this ball before midnight because at that point everything's going to go to crap.
So you do not want that to happen in front of the prince.
You want to make a good impression on this guy.
So cinderella says.
Goes off to the ball drawn by her mice and dog and a pumpkin.
They get to the ball.
She enters the grand entrance area.
She enters.
All of a sudden the prince is struck by her radiant beauty.
They dance.
They danced all night.
I do not think the prince asks her name.
Because you should generally not dance the night away with a guy you do not know the name of.
But i am willing to let her have a pass on this.
Because she was raised by heathens.
So she is having a great time dancing with the prince.
Nobody recognizes her.
All of a sudden the clock starts striking midnight.
So she books it.
She is trying to get to her carriage and get home before everything goes to crap because the fairy godmother actually had some fair points there.
So she is running down the steps in heels which is very very hard.
I i sympathize.
She loses a heel which is fair.
She thinks about going back for it but does not really have time because she still needs to lug it to the carriage.
So she just leaves the heel on the steps.
She gets to the carriage.
They start driving off into the distance.
They make it some distance before the spell ends.
She is left on the side of the road in rags surrounded by mice and dogs and sitting on a dead pumpkin.
Eventually she gets over her sadness.
She makes her way home so that she can wallow in misery under a roof.
Then she is you know just going about her business trying to not make it seem like she actually went to this ball.
What did i say he was?
Let us call him an advisor.
He comes to the door.
He says.
We have this shoe that the prince will marry whoever's foot this shoe fits.
The evil stepmother thinks to herself.
Things did not go over too swell last night.
But if i can shove one of my daughters feet into this shoe we are home free.
I do not remember.
But she sneaks upstairs.
She locks cinderella in her room where she is wallowing in misery and then goes back downstairs.
They are all trying to put this shoe on their feet.
But it is not working obviously.
They have huge feet because they are evil and evil people have big feet.
Everybody knows this.
The brave little mice who have been turned into horses and chased by cats and made her a dress that got ripped to shreds still somehow find it within their little mousy hearts to go down and steal the key to the room cinderella's locked in from the evil stepmother.
They bring it up to her after much trial and error.
Cinderella unlocks the door.
She goes downstairs just as the shoe flies off one of the stepsisters feet and smashes to the floor in a million pieces.
They do not sweep it up immediately.
Which is weird to me because if i were walking around in bare feet i would definitely want all the glass swept up.
Everyone panics because the stepsisters are upset because now there is no shoe to prove that they are the one that the prince was dancing with.
Obviously that is the only reason they cannot prove that.
The advisor is panicking because the king wants the prince to get married.
The prince will only marry the person who fits this shoe.
Then cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says.
I have the other slipper.
Lo and behold she does in fact have the other slipper which stayed behind when everything else went to crap.
Fairy godmother works in mysterious ways.
So cinderella goes.
She shows the slipper to prove that it is in fact the matching slipper.
Then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her tiny foot.
I do not think she should be able to stand in real life.
It fits beautifully of course.
So there was triumphant music.
They all lived happily ever after.
Hadta get the ring first.
"Cinderella went off to the castle , left her horrible life behind and married the prince."
You know nature valley brand?
That is the kind of bread you want.
I do not know what it is.
"You take your pieces of honey wheat , enough for both sides of the sandwich."
You put them in a toaster.
You depress the toaster.
I do not like my bread too toasted.
I like it to be a little golden brown but not so much that you can actually see the marks in the bread.
So just adjust your toaster however much you needta for that to happen.
"While your bread is toastying up , you go to your cabinet."
You get out your peanut butter.
I like chunky.
You can do whatever you want.
You go to your fridge.
Whatever you want.
You put those there.
By this time hopefully your bread is finished toasting.
So you take it.
You gingerly take it with your finger tips and put it on a plate.
You have gotten out the plate at the same time you have gotten out the peanut butter and jelly.
You say.
Then you kind of kiss your fingers because it is a placebo effect.
It makes you feel better even though it is not actually helping anything.
Then you shake out your hand a little bit because the bread was hot.
But you have both pieces of bread on your plate now.
You set the plate down.
You take your knife.
First you do your peanut butter.
The people who do jelly first.
If it is new peanut butter you just got it.
You peel off off that lid.
You think to yourself.
Can i ruin this perfect peanut butter top layer?
You think to yourself.
You take that knife.
You stab it so that you feel less bad about scooping some out.
So you scoop some out.
You spread it on one of the breads which hopefully at this point is hopefully cool enough that you can do that.
So you spread that on there.
You do not want too much.
I would say a centimeter of peanut butter.
You want a decent amount of peanut butter.
Then you scrape the knife to get the peanut butter off of it because you do not want to wash it off in the sink and get another knife.
It sounds like a lot of effort.
Then you put the lid back on the peanut butter.
You pull the jelly toward yourself.
You set the lid down.
If it is new you feel less bad about ruining it because even though it is an equally perfect surface it is kind of darker.
So then what i like to do is i like to stab it also and stir it up a little bit because it is easier to spread if you are not just getting out a gloop of it.
So you stir it up some.
Get it into you know a little liquiddy consistency.
But it is still you know jelly.
Then you angle it over your second slice of bread.
Then you take the knife to scrape some out.
You can try to just scoop some out on top of the knife.
But it will fall off.
A little less than you did for the peanut butter but not much.
Then you take these pieces.
You take the peanut butter piece.
You put it on top of the jelly piece because you do not want the jelly to fall off if you put it on top of the peanut butter piece.
So you take that sandwich.
You flip it so that jelly is on the top and peanut butter is on the bottom.
Then you look at it.
You think to yourself.
Can i eat this?
Then you think.
You put it in your face.
Tyler has been playing soccer by himself because he does not have any brothers or sisters.
So of course he is trying to do a bicycle kick or something like that.
Then he kicks it into the window.
So he kicks the ball through the window.
"It breaks the lamp , stunning his grandfather who is sitting there watching montel williams."
Then of course tyler has booked it by now.
Of course grandpa is looking out the window wondering where the heck that little whippersnapper is.
Okay know why i think this.
But this this maybe this is like all this freud stuff coming out with you doing research.
But i think these people speak spanish.
I do not know why.
So the mother wants this sort of nongendered child to take the umbrella.
She is saying.
It is going to rain.
Then the child said.
Mom told you it is not going to rain.
It is going to rain.
I told you.
Then of course he is walking to school.
He gets really really wet.
He is walking.
He is walking.
He gets there.
He is soaked.
It rains all day long.
So he comes home.
He comes inside.
His mom says.
I told you so.
Then the next day it is still raining.
This kid takes his umbrella because he has learned his lesson.
Hm a lot of stuff going on here.
I guess the cat is in the tree first.
So this little girl she is riding her tricycle or whatever.
Her cat gets in the tree.
But she wants the cat that is in the tree.
So this guy comes along.
He has a ladder.
He thinks that he is going to help this little girl get the cat out of the tree.
Then he while he is up there he accidentally kicks the ladder over.
So now he is stuck.
The cat is still stuck.
The little girl obviously does not care that the man is also stuck in the tree.
Honestly this kind of seems a little silly because that guy should be able to jump from that tree.
Now this dog it seems as though it is violent.
But i think that it is probably after the cat rather than the man.
So i think he should probably just be able to yell at the dog and jump down and get rid of it.
This dog it does not look very violent.
Now i do not know who has called the fire department.
I am assuming that this guy has not.
Judging from this picture this is before anyone had cellphones.
So i am going to blame the old lady that lives across the street whose house we cannot see for calling the firemen so that they can get the cat out of the tree.
So i look and then i tell you with the story closed.
I do not remember those things.
Her dad remarried this really really mean woman who had these really really terrible daughters.
So they all move in together.
I am assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old mean woman would not be marrying him.
But when she moves into the house i hope that dad leaves because she is really really mean to cinderella.
So she is made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do.
Again i do not know where the dad is during all this.
But so she works for a long time because in the story it showed her as a little girl.
So apparently this happened for a long time.
This girl is going to need some help.
So she is still working for the family.
Then she has a lot of animal friends and such.
She looks out the window all the time.
Then there is that castle.
Oh that is where other people live who i am sure have a great life.
So then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince so he can find a wife.
I do not know.
This sounds very crazy as i am saying it.
So they have this dance so that the prince could find a wife.
They invite everybody in the kingdom.
Apparently again her family is pretty welloff because they did not invite the servants.
But her family gets invited.
But the stepmother does not let her come.
But she thinks she is going to come.
So she gets to try on the outfits and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie.
Birds and things like that help her get ready.
You are not going.
In the book they take her necklace and tear her dress and all this other stuff.
I just think that is a little bit over the top.
But they do.
So she hasta stay home.
Well i guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out.
I do not know if she rubs a lamp in there.
It is maybe she read a book.
But anyway she has this fairy godmother.
Which i wonder where she is been all these other years.
So she asked her fairy godmother i guess to go to the dance.
I would probably just ask to move somewhere else.
I do not think that one night is going to help.
So she wants to go to the dance.
"So the fairy godmother gets all her stuff , gets her all gussied up , and then puts her in a pumpkin and sends her away."
So she gets to go to the dance.
It looks like she had a nose job.
If you will look in the book her nose is much much smaller.
Her hair is much much blonder when she goes to the dance.
So something happens.
She gets dressed up.
She goes to the dance.
The lo and behold the prince falls in love with her.
So then she knows she hasta be back by midnight because that is when her terrible sisters i guess are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening.
So anyway she runs away.
She runs her shoes off.
With her glass shoes anyway i would say that that has not been comfortable.
I probably had taken ththem off fifteen minutes after getting there.
So she lost her shoe.
Then all the prince knows is that girl that he loves wore this shoe.
So he sends his lackey guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe.
It is hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit in this shoe.
Either she has enormous feet or very small feet.
I am assuming very small feet because disney does not think that enormous feet on women is lovely as you could even see.
Her nose got smaller and everything got smaller except for her eyes they got bigger.
So she tries on the shoe.
The shoe fits.
Then obviously that means that that is her shoe.
Then everybody's mad that she went to the party.
So then she got to leave that terrible house and marry the prince.
Oh and they lived happily ever after.
Well do i have all the supplies?
So i have all the supplies.
So what i would do is i would go to the cabinet.
I would get out the peanut butter.
I am going to do this for somebody else.
I do not like jelly on my sandwiches.
So i am going to the cabinet.
I get out the peanut butter.
I go to the fridge.
I get out the jelly.
But we are not at my house because we do not have grape jelly.
We only have strawberry.
It only goes on biscuits.
So we do not have grape jelly.
I am babysitting.
Okay so i am babysitting.
I am making the sandwich.
So they have wheat bread because probably someone with children thinks that white bread is you know like the devil or something like that.
So they have wheat bread.
They have organic peanut butter.
They have that gross squeezable grape jam.
I do not know why.
So i go to the drawer.
I get two knives because you have to also spread the jelly even though it is got that squirt out.
So i get two pieces of bread wheat bread.
I put the peanut butter on one side.
Then i put the jelly on top of the peanut butter and then swish it around with the clean knife bebecause you cannot get the peanut butter and the jelly on the knife bebecause it is gross.
Then you put the other piece of bread on.
Then if it is for a older person i would cut it in half diagonal.
If it is for a child i would cut it with an x and make four pieces.
I do not cut the crust off bebecause that is where the nutrients are.
If they do not want it they can peel it off themselves.
Well it looks like one day there is a girl.
She could not find her cat.
"She looked around , could not find it anywhere , and eventually found it up in a tree."
Then she did not want to climb up there herself.
So she got her dad to go climb up the tree.
Then he got stuck.
Then now he cannot get down either.
They do not know what to do.
So the little girl goes and calls the fire department.
Everyone is going crazy.
The end of the story is that they get the ladder.
They go up and rescue the cat and rescue dad.
He is sitting in his living room enjoying himself.
Then he picks the ball up and looks out the window angrily.
Is he goes out.
He gives the ball back.
Then he forgives the boy because he is a nice person.
Well it is obviously raining outside.
But the boy's not listening to his mom who wants him to take the umbrella.
I guess in picture two it looks like that he is he is happy.
But i guess he is just saying.
It does not matter.
He goes outside.
Figures out he really does want the umbrella.
He comes back in.
The mom gives him the i told you so look.
Then he decides to take the umbrella after all.
I do not remember how they were related.
Somehow cinderella comes to live with them.
So she comes when she is really young.
Then she is forced to do all the chores and while the other two sisters live in luxury.
Or there is a royal family.
So the prince is of the age where he needs to get married.
"Oh we needta have a big ball, get all of the pretty women to come out and dance with them."
Then he will find his match.
So they send the royal decree out to everyone.
All the women of suitable age also come to the ball.
So cinderella by herself makes her own really nice ball gown.
Then as she is about to go the other two sisters get really jealous and rip her gown to shreds.
Then the stepmother does not let her go.
She runs out to the courtyard.
She is crying on the steps.
Then her fairy godmother appears out of nowhere.
Alright i am going to give you a really nice gown.
I am going to turn all of your animals friends into horses that are going to carry this carriage.
And then she gets to go.
While she is at the ball she starts dancing with the prince.
So she loses track of time.
The catch is the fairy godmother said that you can have all of this you know the nice ball gown and everything.
But magic is going to run out at when the clock strikes twelve at midnight.
So she is dancing with the prince.
Oh they are meant to be together.
They would look how to get on.
So the clock starts to strike twelve.
She is panicking.
So she runs out.
On the way down the stairs she loses one of her glass slippers.
Another detail i forgot to mention is that she has glass slippers.
She loses one of those and then jumps into the carriage.
They race off.
Then when they get out of sight they are they are turned back into what they really were.
Alright we found this great girl.
But we do not know who she is at all.
All we have is a glass slipper.
Okay how can we find her?
They come up with a plan to visit all of the houses in the city and let all of the women try on the glass slipper.
So the stepmother knows this is going to happen.
So while the prince and his people are visiting their house she locks cinderella up into her room.
Then her her daughters try on the glass slipper.
They try to make it fit but it does not.
Then her the cinderella's helpful animal friends go and steal the key and let cinderella out.
Cinderella comes down and is like.
Oh i will try it on.
The prince knows.
They lock eyes.
So they start to take the glass slipper over to cinderella.
But then the evil stepmother puts out her foot or something or her cane.
The guy carrying the the glass slipper trips on breaks the slipper.
What are we going to do?
We will never know for sure if she is the one!
Oh that is okay bebecause i got the other slipper!
She pulls it out of her pocket.
Then the prince puts it on her.
It fits perfectly.
Then they get married and live happily ever after.
So first you get two pieces of bread.
Then you get peanut butter.
You get jelly.
I guess there is lots of ways to do it.
You know get some peanut butter on there.
It is going to be harder with the peanut butter because peanut butter's real sticky.
If your bread is really soft it is going to tear.
So it might take awhile to smooth out everywhere.
So then you just put the two pieces of bread together so that the peanut butter and jelly stick to each other.
Then you eat it.
That is how you make peanut butter and jelly.
So there was a little girl and her dad.
Her dad got married to a woman who he thought was lovely but was actually not.
She also brought along her two daughters who became cinderella's stepsisters.
Cinderella's dad died when she was young.
The stepmother and stepsisters made her life terrible.
She ended up becoming a maid and you know cleaning the house and got her name cinderella from cleaning the cinders out of the fireplace.
She always dreamed of a better life and could look out at the castle and had her friends the mice who she played with.
"Meanwhile the king was trying to get his son to marry , the prince , and decided to hold a ball."
They sent word to all of the eligible females in the kingdom.
The night of the ball they all got ready.
The stepsisters ended up tearing up cinderella's clothes and essentially telling her that she could not go to the ball and that she was a worthless human being.
Let us see.
They went off to the ball.
Cinderella stayed at home.
While she was bemoaning her fate her fairy godmother showed up and turned a pumpkin into a carriage and turned mice into horses and dressed her in a beautiful ball gown and told her she had until midnight before everything changed back.
So she left in her carriage and went to the ball and danced with the prince.
They fell in love at first sight.
Then the clock struck midnight.
She ran away and dropped one of her glass slippers on the steps.
The prince kept it.
She got back home in time.
Then the prince started searching the kingdom for the girl that he could not find whose foot fit the glass slipper.
The stepsisters locked cinderella into a room when he came to search for her.
Her friends the mice got the key and let her out.
They put the shoe on her foot.
It fit.
So one day there was a dog chasing a cat.
It chased the cat up a tree.
"The cat's owner, a little girl, followed it and was very sad and wanted to get the cat down."
So she pulled in one of her friends to come and help with the cat.
So the friend ended up in the tree as well.
So then the dog was barking at the cat and the friend.
The little girl was trying to get the cat out of the tree still.
Well the firemen came strolling down the road in this small lovely town and discovered the man and the cat in the tree and decided that they would help.
So they came with their ladder.
They rescued the man and the cat.
Everyone lived happily ever after.
So one day there was a little boy named mathew whose mother told him that it was raining outside and he might want his umbrella.
He said.
So out the door he walked.
As he walked down the road it started to rain.
Then it started to pour.
Mathew got extremely wet and decided that it might be a good idea to have his umbrella after all.
"So he went back home to his mom, who was not happy that he was dripping all over her floor, got his umbrella and a nice dry change of clothes and went on happily in the rain being nice and dry to school probably."
Once there was a little rambunctious boy named dennis who had a soccer ball that he was kicking in his yard.
He kicked it a little bit too hard.
It might have gone over the bushes into his neighbor's window.
"It broke the neighbor's window falling into the neighbor's lap where the neighbor looked at it, looked at the broken window, picked it up and yelled out the window at dennis telling him not to do it again."
So to start you need two slices of bread.
You lay them on the counter.
You get your peanut butter and a knife.
You spread peanut butter on both slices of the bread in a nice even thick coating.
Then you need a spoon and whatever flavor jelly you prefer.
You get a little bit of jelly.
Make sure the edges are nicely sealed so the jelly does not leak out.
So then the annual ball came around.
Everyone wanted to go.
Cinderella also wanted to go along with everyone.
Her stepmother would not let her bebecause she wanted her to stay home and clean.
Only her two stepsisters could go.
So then cinderella's actual godmother came and granted her the wish of going to the ball.
She fixed her a beautiful dress.
Cinderella would go and meet her prince charming.
But she hasta get back before midnight because the spell will wear off.
Then the dress would turn back into her raggedy old clothes.
So she hadta run away from the ball and away from her prince charming.
Then she loses her glass slipper.
Then prince charming retrieves the glass slipper and tries to find cinderella.
So he goes on fitting throughout all the kingdom.
Her two other stepsisters could not fit inside the shoe bebecause they wanted to be with prince charming.
Then once cinderella could fit inside her shoe they were all mad at cinderella.
But cinderella eventually went with prince charming.
Then they lived happily ever after.
It was a wonderful day in the park when jack came.
Then he decided to climb this tree and with the convenient ladder that he always brings with him to the park.
So then he was climbing the tree.
Then a dog came after him and knocked over the ladder.
He was stuck in the tree.
Lucy was yelling at the cat to jump down.
So you have two things stuck in the tree.
So the firemen come over.
They hafta decide whether who to save first.
So the firemen firemen hafta go through this long drawn out process to choose who to save.
So they decide to save the cat and then to save jack.
Mark is getting ready to go to school.
His mother stops him and says.
Do not you need an umbrella?
Mark says.
His mother asks.
It is raining outside.
So mark begins to go into the rain.
Then as he walks further and further he gets wetter and wetter.
The rain gets heavier and heavier.
Then once he comes back home he he is drenched in water.
His mother is angry at him because he did not take the umbrella.
But now that he has the umbrella now he can walk in the rain without getting wet.
Timothy was playing soccer with his friends.
One of his friends kicked the ball to timothy.
Timothy kicked the ball as hard as he could and hit his neighbor's window and broke his neighbor's window.
The ball went through the window and broke the vase.
But timothy ran away.
So he did not get his soccer ball back.
His neighbor is standing there wondering.
Who broke my vase and my window?
But he will never know.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you hafta get a loaf of sliced bread.
You hafta have a knife of some sort and peanut butter and jelly.
So you take out two slices of bread.
You lay them side by side.
You take the knife.
You open up the peanut butter.
You scoop out a little bit of the peanut butter with the knife.
You spread it on one of the pieces of bread.
So then you clean off your knife.
Then you go and you open up the jelly.
Then you put the knife into the jelly and spread it on the other slice of bread that does not have the peanut butter on it.
Then you put one slice of bread on top of the other.
Then you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
A boy is playing soccer in his yard.
The boy must have kicked the ball into a window.
It hit it.
The ball broke the window.
It fell into his neighbor's lap.
The neighbor picked up the ball and looked out the window to see the boy.
There is a dog barking at a man in the tree who seems to be stuck.
He has a sad look on his face.
There is firefighters coming to get him down.
There is also a little girl who is trying to save a cat who is in the tree.
She must have biked over on her tricycle.
A mom is trying to tell the boy to take an umbrella probably to school.
The boy tells his mom that it is fine.
It will not rain.
He does not need an umbrella.
So the boy walks to school.
It starts raining really hard.
He sets to come back.
The mom is upset because he is soaking wet.
So then he decides to take the umbrella to school.
So cinderella dad marry remarried a woman with two daughters.
The dad died.
So the stepmother kind of made her a servant in her own home.
One day there was a ball thrown by the prince so he could find his new wife.
The mother gave her a lot of tasks to do so she could not go to the ball.
So her animal friends made her a dress.
She got all her things done and was going to go to the ball.
She found her fairy godmother who made her a dress and a carriage to ride to the ball in.
But it would only last until midnight.
"So she goes to the ball , dances with the prince."
He falls in love with her.
It turns midnight.
She hasta run away.
She leaves behind her glass slipper.
She goes back home to her normal life.
The prince finds the slipper and wants to find cinderella.
But he does not know where she lives.
So he goes to all of the homes in his little neighborhood where he rules.
He tries the glass slipper on everyone is foot.
Eventually he finds cinderella.
They get married and live happily ever after.
I would get two pieces of bread out from a loaf and lay them out.
I would spread peanut butter on both sides of the bread.
Then i would spread jelly on one side.
"So the story starts out , the little girl's cat ends up high in a tree."
A younger male decides to help the little girl out by climbing the tree to help get her kitten down.
So the fire department is called by an onlooker.
The fire department comes save both the male and the kitten.
"So the boy wakes up in the morning , gets ready for school."
His mother tells him that they are calling for rain.
She hands him an umbrella.
But he declines and happily waves goodbye to his mother and heads off to school.
As he is walking to school it starts raining.
He becomes soaked.
He immediately returns back home and asks his mother for the umbrella and continues back to school.
He inadvertently kicks the soccer ball too hard towards a house.
It goes through a bay window and breaks the glass and ends up in his brother's lap.
His brother's sitting down watching tv.
The soccer ball lands in his lap.
"His brother gets up with the soccer ball , looks through the shattered window , and yells at his brother to come inside the house."
So the man's son was playing outside and kicked the ball.
It hit the the father.
The boy was disappointed.
So i think cinderella was a maid.
She went to this ball.
I know.
I do not know.
I do not know what it means.
I do not.
I do not know.
There was a man.
"You hadta do every instruction , open the bag."
I do not hafta open the jar?
I start with two pieces of bread.
Then i take the peanut butter.
You got to put it on both sides.
You got to take.
"On one side of each bread , the side that is facing up , put a layer of peanut butter on it."
You do not want the jelly to soak through.
We will say the right side just to make it simple.
You put the jelly on it.
Then you take this side with peanut butter face up.
Sandwich it right on with the peanut butter face down towards the jelly.
Then you slice it in half.
That is how i make it.
So this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella.
He did not want to take it because he did not believe it would rain.
So right as he started walking outside it started raining.
He gets mad.
He is stomping through the puddles wishing he had an umbrella.
So he comes back to the house wet and gets the umbrella then continues on his journey.
So this little girl was outside with her cat when her cat climbed up a tree.
Her father thought he could rescue the cat.
"So he brought a ladder , placed it on the branch , climbed up."
Then his ladder fell.
For some reason the daughter cannot lift the ladder up to help him out.
So they hadta call a fire department.
The fire department came.
The fire department's on their way to rescue the cat and the father.
John kicked the ball.
It went through the window and landed on his angry next door neighbor's lap.
His next door neighbor walked to the window and looked out.
So cinderella lived with her father.
Her father remarried her evil stepmother and two evil stepsisters.
Then her father died.
The stepmother put her to work.
But she had a a fairy godmother.
There was a ball.
The fairy godmother changed her into this beautiful ball gown.
She got to go to the ball.
She met the prince.
But then everything went away at midnight.
She ran away but she left her glass slipper.
The prince went around looking for the girl that the glass slipper fit.
It fit cinderella.
They lived happily ever after.
You get your bread out of the pantry.
You take two slices of bread out.
"You get your peanut butter out of the refrigerator or the pantry , wherever you keep it."
Then you spread jelly on the other side of the bread.
The mom says.
It is going to rain today son.
I do not need an umbrella.
Lo and behold it starts to rain.
He comes home soaking wet.
Then the next day he took an umbrella to stay dry.
So little little julie had a cat.
The cat went into the tree.
She said.
"Daddy , daddy go get my cat!"
So daddy got the ladder and climbed up to get the cat.
Then the ladder fell.
He could not get to the cat.
So then the cat and daddy are stuck in the tree.
The dog's going crazy because everybody's in the tree.
They called the fire firemen.
They are coming to rescue everybody.
A young boy kicked a soccer ball.
The soccer ball went through a window and landed in a man's lap who was not too happy.
The man looked out the window holding the soccer ball as if he was going to either well most likely yell at the kid who kicked it through the window.
So there was a young woman who did not have any parents whose name was cinderella.
Cinderella hadta go live with her evil stepmother and her three not so nice stepsisters.
She snuck her way into a ball.
While she was at the ball she hadta be back by a certain time or she was going to turn into a pumpkin or something like that.
While she was there she lost her glass slipper.
But she danced with the prince.
The prince loved her.
He was looking for the glass slipper.
"Eventually , in spite of her stepmother and evil stepsister's wishes , the prince eventually found her."
They lived happily ever after.
I would get some bread.
I would take the bread and i would put it on the counter.
I would get the peanut butter out of the the pantry also.
I would get the jelly out of the refrigerator.
I would first spread the jelly because i would not want the peanut butter to get into the jelly if i spread the peanut butter first.
Then i would spread the jelly on one side.
I would wipe it off by spreading whatever was left over on the other side.
I would spread the peanut butter very nice and neatly on the other side.
I would put it together and probably put it on a paper towel and bring it over here and eat it at the table.
So looks like the little boy is refusing an umbrella.
So the mom says.
It looks like the mom's like.
You needta take an umbrella because it is going to rain today.
He said.
He gets outside and realizes that his mother was right.
So he runs back in.
He is not too happy to mother admit his mother was right but reluctantly takes the umbrella and goes about his way.
Looks like a cat ran up a tree.
Little girl realized that it was her cat.
She yelled to her dad to go rescue the cat.
So the dad gets out the ladder.
He climbs up the tree.
When he gets to the top the ladder falls.
As a result the dog who loves the dad starts barking very loudly and alerts neighbors who call firemen who come and rescue the father and ultimately the cat.
Well once upon a time there was a young girl named cinderella.
Her father had remarried a woman who was her stepmother that had two two two daughters that were her stepsisters.
Her father she loved very much.
Then he passed away and left her behind to be cared for by the the stepmother and her her two daughters.
They she showed a lot of favoritism towards her own daughters and used cinderella more as a servant or housemaid than than an actual stepchild.
Cinderella was was made to sleep in quarters that were cold and damp and while everybody else enjoyed the lavish um ness estate.
She hadta do a lot of the menial work and be at everybody's beck and call and really suffered a lot in that state.
Then at the same time the the the king was very upset because his son the prince had not yet married and was was coming to an age where he needed to be married to provide heirs for the kingdom.
So the king made a decree that there was going to be a ball and that all the young maidens kingdom were to be invited and that the son would hafta select from those that attended someone to be his bride and to carry on the the royal tradition.
So invitations were sent out.
"The the stepmother received an invitation and was excited for her two daughters to go and attend the ball but concluded that cinderella would not be allowed to attend the ball , that she would not be eligible and she would be left behind."
So cinderella was extremely disappointed and upset by this and was was locked away so that she could not attend while the others went.
But her in her distress her fairy godmother showed up and granted her the opportunity to have a a gorgeous gown and shoes and and carriage and horse.
Which she took all of the the the animals the the mice and the cats and what have you that were favorites of cinderella and and converted those into a fancy carriage and horses with a carriage master and so forth that took cinderella to the ball.
So she had the opportunity to go.
But the only condition was that she hadta be back home by midnight because everything would go back to normal and the whole whole facade would be revealed after midnight.
So she went.
She had a great time.
She got the opportunity to meet the prince.
They enjoyed some some time together and and became attracted to one another and enjoyed each other's company during the course of the ball.
Of course the the stepmother wanted her daughters to have that opportunity and was rather jealous over this girl that she did not recognize as cinderella at the time.
But tried to force her way into to having the prince recognize her daughters and and and everything.
So then when midnight rolled around cinderella had been having such a good time that she let the time get away from her.
At the very last second she hadta race castle to get in her carriage and and make it home and just barely made it.
But in the course of escaping she left one of her glass slippers on the steps exiting the castle.
At then that is all the prince had.
He did not even know cinderella's name or who she was or where she came from.
So he had this glass slipper and launched an extensive search to find the owner of that slipper so that rekindle his relationship with with the girl.
Of course the the stepmother had no idea that it was cinderella.
But they were bringing the prince and his entourage around to to try a slipper on.
Whoever's foot the slipper fit then they would be recognized as as the new princess.
So the stepmother locked away cinderella once again so that she would not have the opportunity to even be addressed and tried fitfully to make sure that her daughters had the opportunity to get their foot slipper which they did not fit well.
But stepmother realized what was going on she caused the breakage glass slipper thinking that this would prevent them from being able to to place it on cinderella's foot.
So they put it on her foot.
She was recognized new princess.
She and the prince were married and ruled the kingdom.
It was always my hope when i heard the story that she made the evil stepmother and her two sisters the stable mates for the castle.
So once upon a time there was a little girl who had a a pet cat.
The cat climbed up in a tree and got stuck.
So she went and she got her dad to come and help.
The dad tried to climb up the tree and made it partway into the tree to get the cat.
So then they did not know what to do.
So they called the fire department.
The fire department came.
They got the cat.
They helped the dad down outta the tree.
So then they all went home and lived happily ever after.
The the the cat never climbed up the tree again.
Once upon a time there was a little boy.
He he was getting ready to go to school.
His mother came and said.
Before you go to school you needta take your umbrella because it is sposta rain today.
The weather man said it was sposta rain.
The little boy said.
I do not want to take an umbrella to school.
None of the other kids take their umbrellas to school.
So he finally talked her into.
I do not want to take the umbrella.
She finally said.
Okay but if it rains you are going to get wet.
So i do not want to hear any complaints.
So he makes it about halfway to school.
It starts raining.
Then it starts raining even harder.
He hasta run back through the puddles and the rain to his house.
He come back.
He is absolutely soaked from head to toe.
The mother says.
He said.
I should have listened to you.
I should have taken the umbrella.
So she dries him off.
She gives him the umbrella.
He heads back to school.
So a young boy lived in the neighborhood and loved soccer.
He was constantly kicking a soccer ball around his yard and down on the street and everywhere he went.
One day he was going down the sidewalk.
He kicked the soccer ball.
It bounced off the side of his foot right through the plate glass window of his neighbors home.
So his neighbor was sitting watching tv at his house.
Crash here comes the soccer ball through the window.
He picks the ball up.
He looks out the window and sees the boy.
The boy is just very apologetic and says that he will mow the man's lawn or clean his garage or clean his attic to to make up for the cost of the broken window.
So the man said that he would just hold his ball until all that was done and the window was replaced.
They made their deal and that was that.
Well you you start by removing two slices of bread from the the loaf.
You open that.
Then you take a jar of jelly of your preference of flavor.
Once upon a time there was a cat named fluffy.
He got stuck in the tree.
He would not come down.
"So the little girl who is named sarah , called her dad and said that their pet fluffy was stuck in the tree."
", her dad came home from work early and climbed the tree in attempt to get fluffy down."
But fluffy would not budge.
So the dad called the fire department.
They brought the ladder and their fire truck and their fire dog who of course barked at fluffy.
They got fluffy down.
The day was saved.
Everybody went home.
His mom tried to get him to take an umbrella.
She said.
It might rain.
You you should take an umbrella.
Jordan says.
It is not going to rain.
I do not want to carry anything.
I am just going to go.
So he left without the umbrella.
", five minutes later into his walk to school , it starts pouring down rain."
Jordan starts running.
The puddles are splashing.
He is getting soaking wet.
He runs all the way back home.
He is dripping water all over the floor.
So he gets the umbrella and heads back on his way to school.
There was a boy named bo.
He was practicing for soccer tryouts.
He was practicing and practicing for hours when he let the ball get a little out of control.
It went sailing through the neighbor's window.
The glass shatters.
His neighbor who is watching tv is scared to death because the ball comes flying through the window and knocks over the lamp.
He gets up.
He goes looking for of course who kicked the ball through the window.
But he cannot find them.
So he patches the window and goes back to watching tv.
Her father remarried after her mother had died.
She had two daughters.
So cinderella had two new stepsisters.
"A few years later, her father passed away."
She went to live alone with her stepmother and stepsisters.
They treated her very badly.
She cooked and she cleaned and she slaved away all day long.
Then one day the king wanted his son to get married.
So he insisted that his son throw a ball and invite every women in the kingdom to find a wife.
They received the invitation.
Cinderella begged to go.
Her stepmother said “no”.
But she decided to make a dress anyways.
Her stepmother said if all the cleaning was done that cinderella could go.
So cinderella makes a dress and gets all ready.
But when her stepsisters see her dress they get jealous.
They rip the dress to shreds and proceed to go to the ball without her.
"Cinderella is devastated , starts crying."
"Then a fairy godmother appears and offers to give her a dress, a horse and carriage, everything she needs to get to the ball."
She meets the prince.
She dances the night away but she only has until midnight.
So the clock strikes midnight.
She hasta leave before everything turns back to normal.
The horses'll turn back into mice.
Carriage'll turn back into a pumpkin.
Her dress will disappear.
So she runs back to the carriage.
"She leaves a shoe , a glass slipper."
So she makes it home on time.
But the prince still has her slipper.
He says.
I am going to do whatever i can to find this woman.
So he sends his servants out to find the woman who owns the slipper.
They try the slipper on every single woman they find.
They cannot find who owns the slipper.
"When they get to cinderella's house, her stepmother locks her in a room."
The mice hand her the key through the door.
"She manages to get out , try on the slipper and go home with the prince."
They get married and live happily ever after.
I guess you would get a plate and two slices of bread.
Well obviously this girl had a little pain in the ass cat.
It chased a bird up a tree or went after something up a tree.
Her dad went up tree for the cat.
Dog went barking after the dad and knocked the ladder over.
Now you have got firemen running.
They are running off in the distance.
I guess he is going to be up there all day.
Well little kid goes outside.
Mom did not want to give him the umbrella.
So he goes outside anyway.
Gets the house covered in mud.
So she gives him the umbrella and gets him out of the house so she can clean the house.
Little boy wants to play soccer like everybody.
Coincidentally hits the guy watching tv.
He gets up.
Screams at the little kid and calls the cops.
Well little cinderelly's born.
Her parents die when she is a little girl.
Her evil step mom comes in and takes her away to live with her.
She dreams of a better life.
Eventually one day the king's courtesan comes to invite people to a party.
Cinderella wants to go.
Stepmom says.
If you get all the chores done you can go.
So she does chores.
Her stepmom said she cannot go.
She cries.
Fairy godmother comes in.
She goes to the ball.
Tells her if she does not get kissed by midnight she will turn back into the house bitch.
So she goes to the ball.
Something something happens.
She hasta run away.
Prince is left with one slipper.
Starts looking for her.
Well courtesan for the king or whatever is running with the glass slipper.
Do not remember what happens.
She gets the shoe.
Happy joey go lucky.
The end i guess.
I do not know.
Well everybody knows it is best with one slice of bread peanut butter and one slice of jelly.
But if you are going on a trip you do not want soggy bread.
De story i see here.
So he is exercising by play ball.
Yeah dis boy is relaxing.
Dere ting inside de room just relaxing.
Yeah i do not really know what he is doing.
I believe dis picture tells a story from the look.
Dis appear to be de mother.
Probably de child is going to school.
I do not know.
So de mother is holding umbrella.
Probably de de child is demanding something from de mother.
De mother is listening to de child from what de child is demanding from her.
I believe de child is going to school because there is a school bag behind his back.
He is walk walking alone school i believe.
Yeah probably something must have happened to him because de child is showing emotion.
De mother is also showing emotion because you can see that is it is not de way de mother reacted to de child from de previous picture.
So de de mother is looking at de child with surprise.
Using umbrella probably is going to de mother.
Some animals are attracted probably to de fruit of de tree.
I do not know.
De child is attrated to de people dat are on top of de tree.
I believe de tree is in a centralized place because you can see a car around de tree.
You can move in de road around de tree.
Maybe workmen with who are moving along de road.
I cannot remember whether de mother died or so.
So de father was not taking care of her.
I tink dere was a day de father was going to somewhere.
She is demanded for.
So she demanded something from de father.
Then after some time de de father went into de forest or so they wanted to kill de father.
Cinderella was begging.
She begged.
She play friendly with people.
So de prince later married her.
When we we first and foremost we roast ground nuts.
We grind it into paste.
"We add a seasoning , pepper, and other stuff to it."
So we keep it in a container.
At times we just use it to mix anything or we use the peanut butter.
Maybe we use it to eat bread.
So if you want to use it with sandwich you just mix it.
You mix it together with sandwich.
He was kicking it.
Kicking around shooting goals.
Then he kicked it too hard.
So it went through a glass window in someone is house.
The man in the house was sitting and watching tv.
The ball went straight through his window and landed in his lap.
So he got up very enraged and went to go yell at the little boy.
Before the boy left for school his mom wanted to give him an umbrella just in case it rained.
But the boy said that he did not need an umbrella because it was not going to rain and that he would be fine.
Then he went outside.
It was raining.
He hadta walk to school.
He did not listen to his mother.
So he got very wet.
He ended up coming back home soaking wet to get his umbrella.
Then he when he got his umbrella he walked to school very happily and dry.
So and the boy decided to climb the tree to get the cat out of the tree.
Then he got stuck.
So the girl ended up calling the firefighters.
They rushed over with their ladders to come get the boy as well as the cat out of the tree.
The girl was yelling for him that he would be okay.
The dog was also there just barking for the boy to come down.
"So her dad ended up marrying another woman, her stepmother."
So they all moved in together with her two evil stepsisters who were very mean to her as well as the stepmom and just gave her rags to wear and made her clean clean the whole house all the time and do all the chores.
One day she saw that there was going to be a ball at the castle.
She really wanted to go.
She met a fairy godmother who gave her a horse and carriage to get to the ball as well as a nice dress and glass slippers under the condition that she would be back home by midnight.
So she went to the ball.
Noone there knew who she was bebecause they had never seen cinderella out in the town.
She met a prince who only wanted to dance with her.
They danced all night.
Then as the clock struck midnight she she hadta leave.
So she rushed out.
"But on her way out down the stairs, she lost one of her glass slippers."
Then the the prince he found the slipper.
He wanted to find out who this woman was.
So he went all over town fitting the glass slipper on different ladies' feet.
He came to the house and tried it on the stepsisters but it did not fit.
Then eventually he tried it on cinderella after a long time.
It took a long time for her to have her foot tried.
"But when he tried it , it fit."
They he realized that she was the woman that he danced with.
They lived happily ever after.
Well i would go into the fridge.
Then i would get out a plate and a butter knife.
So a little boy is kicking a soccer ball around.
He kicks it either too hard or too far into a window of a house that he is nearby.
The man or the owner the house is sitting in a chair right next to the window.
It hits a lamp right next to him on a coffee table.
"He gets up , picks the ball up and looks out the window to see where the ball came from."
So this mom is telling her son to take an umbrella with him to school.
But he does not feel like he needs it.
"He leaves , realizes that it is raining."
It starts to rain a little bit harder.
So he goes back to his mom.
He finally decides to take the umbrella with him to school.
So it looks like the little girl was playing on her tricycle and probably noticed the cat that was stuck in the tree.
Then the man that is in the tree probably came by and was either trying to help get the cat out of the tree or the dog chased him up the tree bebecause he was trying to bite him or a combination of the two.
Then he probably decided since the girl was looks to be really young to call the fire department to help them get the cat out of the tree as well as himself.
So cinderella herself she was brought into a family.
She had two older sisters.
Her sisters treated her poorly.
They made her clean and do all the chores of the house.
One day a letter came from the the king of the kingdom and saying that the prince needed somebody to marry him one day.
The two older sisters thought for sure that it would be them since they were older and more mature and cinderella was just basically a servant.
Cinderella's wearing a pearl necklace.
Her sisters rip it off of her neck and break it.
"She feels very bad about that , very sad that they broke the necklace."
So she does not go initially.
Then the the the fairy shows up and kind of grants her her wish of having a horse and carriage and a beautiful dress to dress up in.
She goes to the palace where the prince picks her to dance with.
However when the clock strikes midnight she leaves.
On the way down the stairs she she steps out of one of the glass shoes.
The one of the people in the palace finds the shoe.
They know that it was three sisters.
So they try to find who it was.
It only fits cinderella.
Then they live.
That that the prince realizes it was her that he was dancing with.
They live happily ever after.
So you would first take the bread.
Then spread the peanut butter on one or both of the slices of bread as much as you want.
"There was a young boy practicing soccer , kicking the ball."
He kicked it.
It went through a window on accident.
The man was not very happy when a soccer ball came through his window.
He stood up to see who kicked the soccer ball through his window.
There is a young boy and his mom.
His mom's trying to give him an umbrella.
He refuses it.
He does not want to take it.
The mom's not happy when he refuses the umbrella.
Then he goes outside.
It starts to rain.
Then it starts to pour down rain.
He comes home.
He is soaking wet.
His mom is mad that he is wet because he refused the umbrella and sends him back out with the umbrella.
There was a little girl riding her tricycle.
Her cat somehow got up in the tree.
The dog is barking because he wants the cat.
That is probably why the cat ran up the tree.
Then a man climbed up in the tree to try to get the cat.
He cannot get down.
The firefighters are coming to come rescue the man because his ladder fell down and to rescue the cat.
So there is a little girl named cinderella.
She is brought into a house with a stepmom and two stepsisters.
"She grows up without her father , just with the stepmom."
But she makes friends with the the talking animals.
She dreams of going to this castle to to go to a ball with the prince.
Then her stepsisters get mad.
They tear apart her dress.
They tell her that that she cannot go to the ball with them.
Her sisters go off to the ball.
Then cinderella has a fairy godmother that gives her a beautiful dress and sends her off to the ball with glass slippers.
She gets there.
She dances with the prince.
They fall in love.
But the clock strikes midnight.
She loses a slipper.
She hasta run home because the magic is wearing off.
Then the prince comes and finds her by bringing the glass slipper around trying to see whose foot it will fit.
Then they fall in love once he finds it is her.
You take two slices of bread.
You would lay them out on the table.
You get out the peanut butter and the jelly.
You would scoop out some peanut butter and slather it over one slice of bread.
Then put one slice of bread on top of the others so the peanut butter and the jelly are facing.
He kicked it up.
It went through the window and hit mister johnson's leg.
He picked up the ball to throw it back to johnny and also to go talk to his mom about paying for his window.
Johnny and his mother were arguing about him taking his umbrella to school.
He decided to leave without the umbrella.
"He went outside , saw that it was raining , went back inside."
But then or he decided to take the umbrella and then walked to school dry.
The cat fluffy decided to climb up the tree.
Her owner sally was riding her bike.
But the dog saw mister johnson in the tree.
Knocked over his ladder so he was stuck.
So then the fire department came to save both him and the cat.
"So when cinderella was young her father married a new woman who had two daughters , so the wicked stepsisters."
The father died.
So cinderella hadta grow up with her stepmother and her two stepsisters.
"But they treated her as a servant , made her wait on them."
"The prince's father , so the king , decided that the prince needed to get married."
So he put out some sort of call for women to come to a ball so that his son can find a bride.
So they all decided to dress up for the ball.
Cinderella the all the animals help her bebecause all the animals love her and help her make a dress.
But then the wicked stepmother finds out.
I do not know.
They break off her necklace.
They tear up her dress.
They go to the ball.
There were four horses.
Then you had the pumpkin carriage and the guy who drives the pumpkin carriage.
"So she goes to the ball , meets the prince , and they dance."
Then the clock strikes twelve.
It starts to strike twelve.
Then she hasta go bebecause then she will turn back into normal cinderella.
So as she is running away she leaves one of her glass slippers.
But then when it becomes midnight everything turns back to normal.
But she still has a glass slipper.
But the king saw you know how in love the prince was with cinderella.
So he sends his servant to find the woman that fits the shoe.
She has the shoe to show that it was her.
But then the stepmother trips either cinderella or the servant that had the shoe in the hand that breaks.
He had the shoe.
Then it breaks.
Oh well i have the other one.
Then the mice bring the key up the stairs to get her out of the attic.
Then they live happily ever after.
Well first you needta have all the ingredients in your house.
So you needta have the bread.
"You needta have peanut butter, jelly, and one or two knives, depending on if you do not want to mix your toppings."
So you will hafta take the bread out of whatever area you have it to put it onto the counter.
Then you will take the peanut butter and the jelly out and put them on the counter.
"My personal preference , i put peanut butter on first."
So you use the knife to scoop peanut butter out and spread it onto the bread.
Then you use the same knife or a different knife and take jelly out and put it onto the bread.
You put the two pieces together.
Now you have a sandwich.
I think i do fine.
Okay well i published a book.
She had other stepsisters.
She hadta clean the house while her other sisters did not.
She went to the ball.
She met a prince.
She went in the coach which was a pumpkin.
Anyways at midnight stroke of midnight she lost contact with the prince.
He went ahead and looked through the whole town for some little glass slipper that she had worn that night.
Then they met and lived happily ever after.
I think i am pretty good.
No i do not.
Well i think giving the first speech i ever gave was a good thing.
I was very anxious about it because noone had ever asked me to give a speech before.
I carefully wrote everything down and wrote four pages of notes and got up.
I knew i had exactly fifteen minutes or no more no less.
I had a group of about twenty five.
I read my notes.
I threw in a couple of spontaneous jokes and finished in twelve minutes.
So everyone seemed to like it.
I think i can do it.
First panel has a kid kicking a soccer ball.
The the ball goes through the man's window.
It ends up knocking over the man's lamp.
The man stands up with the soccer ball looking at the hole in the window and thinking about what he is going to do next.
Oh i can do this.
The mother is trying to tell the son that he needs an umbrella.
He is going to go out because it is going to rain.
The son is telling his mother that he does not need it.
He goes out in the rain and gets really wet and comes back home.
His mother's does not like how wet he is.
So he make sure to goes out with an umbrella next time.
There is a cat that is stuck in the tree probably because the dog has chased the cat into the tree.
A little girl's crying because her cat is stuck in the tree.
She is come over on her tricycle.
"A man, probably the girl's father, has climbed the tree with a ladder."
He seems to be stuck too.
The fire department shows up with a bigger ladder.
Presumably they are going to get the cat and the father out of the tree.
I cannot explain all of these.
I think maybe the other two would have been her stepsisters.
They all wanted to go to the ball.
The stepsisters got to go.
But cinderella hadta stay home and do chores that involved a lot of sweeping and dirt.
However a fairy godmother shows up and does a lot of hand waving with her wand.
She has a beautiful dress.
The problem is that she hasta leave at midnight or else her coach will turn into a pumpkin.
The prince falls in love with her and wants to know how to see her.
She ends up leaving at the last minute but manages to leave a glass slipper behind.
The prince tries to figure out whose foot gets to go in the glass slipper.
The two stepsisters cannot fit in the glass shoe.
The prince says.
They live happily ever after.
Well you take two pieces of bread.
You put them out.
You take a jar of peanut butter.
Then you take a jar of jelly and open it up and put jelly on the other slice of bread.
Then you put the two slices together.
How do i think i speak english?
I am one of the few people who can say i met my wife in church.
We we attended quaker meeting in in florida avenue friends' meeting down in washington.
I sat behind her.
After a meeting was over as in the manner of friends we shake hands with people.
I looked into her eyes and said.
Would you like to buy a cup of coffee with me?
So there you go.
See i did not find her in a bar.
Little ralphie had just received for his birthday a new soccer ball.
"He had inadvertently kicked it through the picture window of his neighbor, mean old mister smith."
Mister smith was sitting calmly in his chair in his living room when the soccer ball crashed through the pane of glass knocking over a lamp on his table and startling old mister smith.
He looked out the broken window and held the soccer ball and yelled.
You want this ball little boy?
You will hafta come and get it and pay for the broken window!
Alright it looks like little charlie is refusing to take an umbrella from his mother.
"He is leaving , i presume , for school."
His mother's looking sternly at him with the umbrella in her hand.
But he is waving goodbye and seems content to go without it.
However halfway down the street on his way to school the rain begins.
Little ralphie's covered with rain.
He is stomping through puddles.
He realizes he is made a tragic mistake.
He gets home drenched looking unhappy.
His mother looks i as if.
I told you so.
The final pane of the picture shows little ralphie with an umbrella in the rain whistling a happy tune.
Presumably the story begins when melissa's cat fluffy climbed up a tree and was not able to get down.
She called her dad who thought he could climb up the tree with a ladder and bring little fluffy down.
But clearly he was chased by their neighbor's dog.
Consequently the ladder that her dad was using to climb the tree fell down.
So he was trapped on a branch.
The dog is barking at the base of the tree.
"Some wise neighbor called , like they should have called in the first place , firemen."
In this case they most may hafta rescue the dad.
But she was forced to work cleaning the cinders out of the fireplace.
Never let her go out and socialize.
The night of the ball at the local palace the stepsisters and cinderella all thought they would love to be invited.
However because cinderella was a a cinder girl dressed in rags she was unable to go.
However a fairy godmother appeared.
Can i go to the ball?
"The fairy godmother equipped her with a dress and shoes, specifically little glass slippers and a pumpkin carriage to take her to the palace where she met and danced with the handsome prince but said."
I hafta leave by midnight or my coach will turn into a pumpkin.
The prince did not believe her.
"But she ran down the steps , reached the coach before it turned into a pumpkin pulled by mice , but left one of her glass slippers behind."
The next day the prince searched his kingdom from top to bottom looking for the owner of this delicate little glass slipper because she was such a lovely young thing.
They went to the house of the wicked stepmother.
The two wicked stepdaughters tried desperately to get their fat ugly feet squeezed into the little glass slipper but failed.
The prince said.
You try it on sweetheart.
It fit perfectly.
She lived happily ever after marrying the prince.
No i do not know what happened to the stepsisters.
I neglected to talk about the bluebirds of happiness.
Oh there is dumbo oh.
You do not remember those.
Yeah he dug under the fence.
His mom would not give him dinner.
He hadta go to bed without dessert.
How how i would make one?
"I would take two slices of wonder bread, a knife, a jar of peanut butter, and a jar of black raspberry preserves."
I think i do pretty well.
You mean just conversationally?
Then yeah i do.
You know great weather for the whole week.
You know it was a small town.
He is kicking the ball.
The ball goes through a window.
We see that it goes right into a person's home.
The person is sitting only a few feet away.
It knocks over the lamp.
The person gets up and looks to see what just happened.
The mother is trying to give her son an umbrella.
He looks like he is about to leave the house.
He tells his mom.
No i do not want the umbrella.
He walks outside.
It is raining out.
It starts raining even harder.
He runs back home.
His mom's looking at him like.
I told you to bring an umbrella.
So now he has the umbrella.
She sees there is a man stuck in the tree.
There is a cat stuck in the tree.
There is a man stuck in the tree.
It looks like the the man was trying to rescue the cat but he got stuck too.
Now the firemen are coming.
I think i might have at one or.
She lives with her aunt and her three.
They they treat her very badly because she is the the steprelative.
"They make her do all of the work around the house, the cooking, the cleaning, and while they sit around and eat bonbons and take baths."
One day they let her come to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing this lavish party for his son and is going to be looking for a bride.
The stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince will want to marry one of her three daughters.
Cinderella hears about it.
The stepmother says you know she is going to hafta help to make the dresses for her daughters.
And she can stay at the house while they go to this fancy party.
They you know all get all excited and get ready and go.
While cinderella's at home cleaning up her fairy godmother comes and tells her that she is going to help her go to the ball.
She waves her magic wand.
The pumpkin turns into a stage coach.
Her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown.
She is whisked away to this lavish party.
And she is also given these glass slippers to wear.
Of course she comes into this party.
"Nobody recognizes that it is her , including her stepmother and her stepsisters."
So she is this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party.
Of course the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the stepsisters.
He dances with her.
They immediately fall in love.
They have a a dance.
In the middle of this dance she remembers her her fairy godmother's instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken.
So she realizes that it is almost midnight.
She runs from the palace.
In doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes.
She gets home just in time.
You know she stepmother and the stepsisters come home she you know is is home in her tattered clothes again.
She is cleaning.
She asks them how the party went.
They they are not happy because the prince did not notice them of course.
But then he wants to find this mysterious girl.
The only way that he has to find her is the glass slipper that he found.
But he decides he is going to go to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on.
That will be the way he will identify this girl.
So he eventually arrives at the stepmother's house.
Of course the three girls run right over because they they know that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly.
Of course none of them do because their feet are too big.
They the stepmother figures out that the the shoe belongs to cinderella.
She tries to hide cinderella.
I think it was the fairy godmother who who comes along and rescues cinderella.
Anyway they they free cinderella.
The prince sees her and has her put on the shoe.
Of course it fits.
They get married.
I would get two slices of bread.
I would put peanut butter on both slices of bread.
Then i would take the jelly.
I would put it on one slice of the bread.
Then i would put the one slice of bread on top of the other.
How much detail do you want?
I got married in nineteen seventy six.
At the reception back in those days i was not much of a hugging type person.
My brother inlaw is very much a hugging type person.
So we are going down the reception line.
When i got to him he.
I stuck my arm straight out at him like.
No you are shaking my hand.
The boy kicks the soccer ball.
The soccer ball hits the window.
The soccer ball breaks through the window into the man's house.
It knocks the lamp off the table.
Now the man is looking out the window holding the soccer ball as if to find out where it came from.
The mom appears to be telling the child to take the umbrella.
The child does not want the umbrella.
He goes out walking.
It starts raining.
He turns around and runs back home.
The mother's looking at him like.
I told you so.
Then he ends up carrying the umbrella and going out after all.
No i do not need an umbrella.
Boys did not want to carry umbrellas.
We wear a raincoat or a hat or something.
She is got her hands out waiting for kitty.
The man went up the tree apparently to get the kitty.
The ladder has now fallen down.
There is a dog down there barking.
So the man cannot jump down but the fire truck with the real leader has finally come to the rescue.
Let me make sure i am remembering the right fairy tale then.
You know we had these when i was a kid.
She is the good kid cleaning up.
No no no i mean the storyline no?
Well it is kind of weird because we go from that to that.
Remember it skipping like that but it is been a long time.
"She goes to the ball , bippity boppity boo."
Oh lord i can hear the music.
She meets the handsome prince.
He comes around to find out whose slipper glass slipper.
He comes around to find out whose it is.
The evil mother hides her.
Yeah i guess so.
I am not sure from the story if she was the adopted daughter or what she was.
But cinderella was the daughter that the rest of the family did not particularly care for.
She had a mother and of course stepsisters who did not like her.
When it came time to go to the ball they were not going to let her go.
They would not give her any nice clothes etcetera because she was not worthy of going to the ball with them.
So they go to the ball.
"Along comes her fairy godmother who does her magic with her wand and gets her a beautiful gown, turns a pumpkin into her carriage, turns the mice into horses to pull the carriage."
They go off to the ball.
The handsome prince fell for her.
But she hadta leave by the stroke of midnight or all her magic went away.
So she goes rushing down the stairs to leave at the stroke of midnight.
One of the glass slippers falls.
It gets left behind.
She comes home.
Everything turns back to normal.
Nobody knows any better.
But then the prince starts scouring the land with the glass slipper because he knows if he finds the girl who fits the magic glass slipper he can find his princess.
The two stepsisters cannot fit into the shoes.
The mother insists there is nobody else.
But lo and behold somehow cinderella comes out and is found and fits the glass slipper beautifully.
There she has her handsome prince.
They live happily ever after.
I would take two slices of bread.
Smear probably spread the jelly on the same one.
I think i speak english adequately.
I do not know.
My father came from work to watch me.
Somewhere there was a line about giving a dog a biscuit.
I said this line.
"I gave the dog a biscuit , a bone , a biscuit , a bone."
I saw him laughing at me from the audience.
I will never forget.
There is a young boy who is kicking what is probably a soccer ball.
He kicks it and right into a window.
Goes right through the window practically on top of the lap of this guy who is sitting there.
He gets up and has the ball in his hand and is standing by the window and looking out.
The child is going outside.
I do not know whether she is taking it away from him or giving it to him.
In the second one it looks like he is reaching out for it although maybe he just gave it back to her.
It is raining on him.
He goes back to his mother.
Then he takes the umbrella.
He looks a little happier because he took it and is not getting rained on.
She has a bicycle.
It is probably the daddy sitting up in the tree.
"Whether he used the ladder to try to climb up there or climbs up without it , i do not know , but he seems stuck up there."
What he is barking at i am not sure if he is barking at the man.
The firemen are coming with their ladder.
The truck is sitting on the street in the back.
There is a bird singing away in the tree!
The daddy looks a little abashed.
Am i using the book with the pictures?
You might want to cover that up.
"Now there is a picture of a handsome prince with his wonderful standing by a fountain , i think."
Cinderella is standing next to him.
He seemed very nice to her.
But lo and behold out of the window the mean stepmother and her two mean sisters were watching.
That is what happened.
They do not look happy about what is going on down there.
The prince is talking to his father.
They arrange to have a ball.
The invitation somehow get around.
The stepmother and the girls hear about it.
Let us see.
I guess she asks to go with them.
I am trying to remember if that was pictured or not.
Of course they say no.
The fairy godmother comes.
She trains the mice into white horses.
She turns the pumpkin into a wonderful coach.
I guess she does not come home.
Cinderella's stepmother locks her in with the key.
The mice find the key and bring it all the way downstairs or all the way upstairs and let her in or let her out.
The prince comes around.
The shoe fits her.
They all lived happily ever after.
Well here is a neighborhood guy playing soccer.
Oops he kicked it too hard.
It went right through his neighbor's window into the neighbor's lap while he was relaxing.
So then the neighbor looked out the window with the ball.
That is the end of these pictures but i imagine that he found the guy and asked him to correct the mistake.
I guess mom offered a young child an umbrella to go out.
The boy of course said.
No i just do not need this umbrella.
He goes out.
He starts walking.
He may be walking to school bebecause he has a backpack.
It is starting to rain.
It is starting to rain really hard.
He is getting really wet.
So then he goes home to mom.
He walks in really sopping wet.
Mom does not look too happy either because he is really sopping wet.
Finally he takes the umbrella and goes to school.
The dog chased the cat up the tree as often happens.
She wants to get the cat down.
So she tries to get her dad to the climb the tree to get the cat.
He is having a good time.
He is kicking the ball.
Ugh oops by accident the ball goes through the window of his house.
Where does it land?
It lands right next to his father who is totally surprised because he hears the crash window first.
The ball lands practically in his lap.
Dad picks up the ball.
He looks out the window saying.
What is going on?
He sees his son.
So at the end here he is contemplating.
But he is going to hafta fix fix fix or pay for the window.
So we will hafta tall call sonny in to have a talk.
The young man here is going off to school.
His mom says.
There is a ninety five percent chance.
I do not need an umbrella.
Nobody carries an umbrella anyway.
So off he goes sure that everything's going to be fine.
He is walking.
Uhoh it is starting to rain.
Oh no it is really raining hard.
I have got to turn back and get that umbrella.
He goes back.
He goes home.
He walks in.
Mom looks at him.
He is drenched.
He hasta get changed.
But then he goes out with his umbrella having listened to mom.
Her dad is says.
I i will get the cat down out of the tree.
So the cat's not going to get down out of there.
There is a dog at the bottom of the tree.
He is barking.
So the cat's not going to come down on his own.
So dad climbs up the tree.
Lo and behold the ladder falls down.
Now we have both the kitty cat and dad stuck in the tree.
So a neighbor has actually seen all this transpire and has called up the fire department to come and get dad and the cat down from the tree.
They made her do all the housework.
They made her do all the cleaning.
They made her do everything.
She just kind of had a sad isolated life where i think her mother died when she was very young or something.
Then one day i think a fairy godmother granted her three wishes.
I think she wanted to go to a ball where the prince was going to be and everything anything like that.
So the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach.
But she hadta be back by midnight or everything was going to turn back into what it was originally.
So she did all the work and got everything ready.
The sisters went off.
So she went off in her coach and went.
The she actually met the prince.
He fell in love with her.
They danced the night away.
But then the stroke of midnight she hadta run.
She left.
She had glass slippers.
One of her glass slippers got got left.
So she her clothes turned to rags again.
When he came to the house the stepsisters tried to put their big feet into that slipper.
It did not work.
The prince like.
She lived happily ever after.
I should tell you that?
I would take two pieces of bread.
I would take peanut butter.
I would take a knife.
I would spread the peanut butter on the bread.
Then i would take a knife and put some jelly on the sandwich.
So many peanut allergies in house that i take a spoon and put that on and then do that.
Then i would put the top.
I would cut it.
I would serve it.
A young boy is kicking a soccer ball.
He accidentally kicks it through a window.
The man sitting in the room hears and sees the soccer ball come through the window.
He retrieves the soccer ball and looks out to see who may have kicked it.
Should i start?
A boy's mother offered her son an umbrella.
The boy refused to take the umbrella.
When the boy went outside however it started to rain.
It rained hard.
The boy came home sopping wet.
He regretted not taking the umbrella.
"The next time he went out , he walked with the umbrella outside."
I guess you do not usually have a class when you are doing this.
You need a soundproof room.
A girl's father climbed a tree in order to retrieve a cat that got stuck up on the tree.
In the meantime the fire department was called.
They came to rescue the cat and possibly the father.
The girl was waiting there ready to catch the cat if it should jump down.
The dog was barking man on a branch in the tree.
Okay so i just tell you what happened in picture one?
So there was a little boy who was kicking a soccer ball.
He kicked it outside.
It went into a window.
Then it broke the window.
Oh i see.
Then it hit a lamp.
The ball landed i guess.
The man that caught the ball.
He looked out the window at the broken glass.
Okay so the mom is going to hand a little boy an umbrella.
It looks like he is going to go somewhere with a backpack on.
Then he goes outside.
It starts raining.
Oh he steps in a puddle.
Oh he came home.
I think his mom is angry at him.
Maybe he forgot to use the umbrella.
Then he went back outside.
He used the umbrella.
Oh gosh there is a lot going on here.
There is there is a cat in a tree.
Let us see.
The girl is trying to get her cat down.
So maybe the dad climbed up the ladder to help get her cat down.
Oh then the ladder fell.
Maybe he used the ladder to get the cat down.
Then the ladder fell down.
She is trying to catch this cat maybe?
I do not know why these people are here.
Maybe they are coming to help get the cat down.
I do not know why he is upset.
I do not know what the dog is doing.
How i would make one?
I would use two pieces of bread.
I would put them down on the table.
Then i would take the peanut butter out of the cabinet.
I would take the jelly out of the refrigerator where i keep it.
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread.
Then i would use a knife for that.
I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread.
I put the two pieces of bread together.
Then i would cut them either in half or on a diagonal.
Then i would wrap it in cellophane.
For one of the boys to take to school.
Then i would put it in the freezer.
Because i make five at a time.
The boy's kicking what looks like a soccer ball.
Only it goes through the window.
It alarms this man who notices what is happening.
He looks out the window to see who is done it and what is happened.
Well the boy is leaving home.
"His mother , probably his mother , is suggesting that he take an umbrella."
She i think she is suggesting pretty strongly.
He says no he does not need an umbrella.
Probably says it is not going to rain.
Walks out and it is raining.
Walks along further and it is raining even harder.
Even perhaps windy bebecause the rain is slanted.
He is walking through puddles.
He gets home pretty wet dripping.
"She gives him the umbrella again , i assume."
Now he is walking out a little happier with the umbrella over his head.
Okay then girl here who is riding a tricycle apparently.
Her she either notices the cat up the tree or saw him go up.
I think her father or somebody was trying to get up there to get the cat.
But he got stuck.
He looks kind of dismayed.
The dog here is barking up at the man stuck.
For all of this they the fire department has come out to rescue everyone with a ladder.
He really wants to make it.
He has a soccer ball.
"He is practicing soccer skills , soccer dribbling and kicking."
He got too close to the house kicking.
He kicked.
It flew in a direction he did not really want it to go to.
It went through the window.
It went through the window.
It just happened to be his father was sitting in the living room when the ball came through the window.
His father grabbed the ball and looked at the broken glass and was not happy.
He is trying to run out the door.
His mother is offering him an umbrella.
He does not want it because he is he is he is got to go.
He starts walking to class.
It then it starts to rain.
Then he says.
Oh gee i think i better go back and get that umbrella.
He walks back and asks his mother for the umbrella.
Mother gives it to him this time.
He is walking to class.
He is going to be late but he is still on his way with an umbrella.
Her cat actually runs up the tree.
Little cat will not come down.
Okay and then little sally's neighbor comes by and offers to help to get the cat down.
So he goes up the tree.
He gets stuck in the tree too.
So they hafta basically fire department to get both of them down.
Cinderella cinderella lives with her stepmother and her stepsisters.
Her stepmother makes her do all the work and all work and no play.
They do kind of know about cinderella.
They invite her but her evil stepmother locks her up so that she cannot go to the grand ball.
Basically her cinderella's fairy godmother comes and visits her and says.
Yes i will make.
"Gives her a you know brand new clothes , brand new shoes , and a nice coach."
She gets locked up by her stepmother in the room the evening of the ball so that she cannot go.
But the fairy godmother comes by and gives her using magic of course.
New clothes a coach and new shoes to go to the ball.
"So she goes to the ball , has a great time with the prince."
But she hasta be back by a certain time because then if she does not get back everything disappears.
So she is got to leave very quickly just before midnight.
In a rush she loses one of her shoes.
She is dancing and hadta leave very quickly because it is approaching midnight.
So she hasta get back to her room before the stepmother finds out she is gone.
So she rushes out of the palace and loses one of her shoes and gets back in time before the stepmother arrives.
But the prince is really enchanted by her and wants to find her.
He searches the entire kingdom for somebody whose foot fits that shoe.
Eventually they do find cinderella.
The shoe fits.
They live happily ever after.
You put the jelly peanut butter on first.
Then put the jelly on top if you eat peanut butter.
Okay the boy kicked the soccer ball.
It flew into the window on the house next door probably and broke the window.
It fell inside the man's house.
It hit the lamp and broke it.
The man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid.
The kid probably ran away.
He is going to go knock on his daddy's door and say.
Pay me for my broken window.
Mama said to the little boy.
It is supposed to rain today.
The little boy says.
I do not need an umbrella.
It is not going to rain on me.
Then he walks to school.
It starts to rain.
It rains really hard.
So he hasta run back home.
He is all soaking wet.
He hasta change clothes probably.
Then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry.
Well the little girl has a cat that the dog chased up the tree.
"Then a nice man , maybe her daddy , came along."
He had a ladder.
He climbed up in the tree to get the cat.
Then the ladder fell down.
So somebody else watched this whole deal while the dog's still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody.
They came with their truck and ladder.
Not quite there yet but they are getting there.
There is a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them.
I am going to catch the bird and eat her.
The firemen rescued them all.
I do not think i remember the beginning.
I obviously do not remember a lot of this.
I do not remember any of these things from when i was a kid.
I used to read science fiction.
I still do.
Well let us see.
"If i remember, cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl."
The nice man took her home to his family or somebody.
The stepmother had already had daughters.
They took her in.
But they treated her like a servant.
She got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out to wear.
An invitation came to the family to attend a ball i think in honor of prince charming or somebody.
The evil stepmother wanted her daughters to get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and be rich.
So they all got fancied up to go to the ball.
Cinderella was not asked if she wanted to go.
She wanted to go.
She was crying about it.
A good fairy godmother came along.
I am not quite sure how she got there.
She turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses.
She turned the mice into something.
Anyway and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers.
She went to the ball after everybody else had already left.
When she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her.
They danced the night away.
Then the fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning.
So she hadta be sure to leave by midnight.
She was running down the stairs to get to her coach.
She lost a glass slipper.
"The prince picked it up and was calling out to her , i think."
She jumped in the coach.
They ran away from the ball.
It turned back into a pumpkin.
Her clothes turned back into rags.
She had one glass slipper on her foot.
He wanted to find her.
He they took the glass slipper that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs.
They went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit.
The evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper.
It would not fit because they had big feet.
Finally cinderella got to try on the slipper.
It fit.
Prince was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry.
So he found out.
They told him i guess.
All the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of cinderella then.
She married the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
So we are going to do something a little different.
Well oddly enough i never had peanut butter and jelly growing up.
I still have not had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
It was not part of my growing up.
But i would take two pieces of white bread.
Probably if it were me i would put it on both pieces of bread.
Then i would put jelly in the middle.
Well grape jelly i think would go good with peanut butter probably.
Then i would smush it together.
Then i would cut it in half diagonally.
I believe.
We did not eat peanut butter growing up.
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all.
Occasionally i eat peanut butter out of a jar because it is a protein.
I my stomach is growling at me you know.
I listen to people speaking spanish.
You know i picked up a word or two.
I usually can figure out what they are saying when they are trying to speak english.
People who speak.
I do not know what language is that pakistan.
That there is multiple languages.
I hear arabic i people wherever i go.
So i hear english that is accented that way.
Most of the time i can figure them out too.
Well i always wanted to do horseback riding.
A friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at rockcreek park stables in the district.
She wanted to go but she did not want to go by herself so she asked me to go with her.
Since i would always sorta wanted to do that i went with her.
They taught english style riding.
We took this introductory group of lessons.
She quit and i kept on.
"In fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids , my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp."
I learned a lot.
I enjoyed that for a couple years until i had sort of a accident.
They tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy.
You know we would be.
He would go like that at sound.
I usually went right off you know.
And i do not land on my feet.
So i sorta landed on my lower back and so that is caused me problems.
I did not go back after that.
But it was really nice while i did it.
Little bit of almost jumping.
The best part was riding the jump trail in rockcreek park which is a a horse trail that they have let the usually trees fall across.
My horse because he did not like his neighbor horses.
That is not a good place to be when other horses are moving along.
"Because horses being herd creatures , they want to catch up."
So the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles.
He is running to catch up.
But now i do helicopters and it is better.
This is a tough one but i will say it anyway.
It was a sad one but it had a great impact on my entire life.
We were dispossessed from our apartment.
At that time when that happened i made up my mind that i will never be poor again.
That i will not rely on a man.
That i can make it on my own.
I certainly have.
Okay here is a little boy who is having a good time.
He kicks the ball and unfortunately it breaks a window.
The the ball rolls into the a man's home.
"He looks at the window, holds the ball, and looks to see who kicked the ball."
I want you to know i am enjoying this.
Mama is telling this little boy.
It is raining out.
You hafta take the umbrella.
He is saying.
Aw shucks i do not need an umbrella.
So he goes outside.
Of course it is raining.
He is annoyed with himself.
He is trying to hold his head to get out of the rain.
He comes in.
He finally admits to his mother.
Yup i guess i need the umbrella.
He walks away with the umbrella.
A little girl was riding her bike.
The the cat was following her.
The cat ran up the tree.
She comes back crying to the father and the mother.
The father says.
I will get the cat out of the tree.
He takes the ladder.
He climbs the tree.
The ladder falls down.
"In the meantime , a dog comes along and is barking at him."
So it does not come down.
The kid's still crying.
I want my cat.
I want my cat.
Anyway either the man uses his cell phone or she cries to her mother.
They get the the fire people to use the ladder to get the cat down.
Cinderella lives in a home with a wicked mother and two ugly mean sisters.
She is really abused in every way.
They take tremendous advantage of her.
"She is the cleanup person , she wears rags , and all that sort of thing."
Anyway they hear that there is a great ball coming up.
The two daughters and the mother are going to the ball.
Of course they are going to leave cinderella home.
They want cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on.
So she does.
She thinks about the ball.
She makes a wish.
The wish is that she can go to the ball.
When a fairy godmother appears and tells her.
Yes you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight.
She says.
The fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well.
She gets into this big pumpkin.
When she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her.
She hears the midnight stroke.
She gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise.
So she goes running down the steps.
She loses her shoe.
She gets home okay.
The prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit.
It does not seem to fit anyone.
The mean mother has him try on the the shoes on the two ugly daughters.
Finally cinderella comes down.
"Although the mother does not want him to , he tries on the shoe."
It fits her.
I believe he he then wants to marry her.
"I would try and get good bread , like whole wheat bread or something like that."
I would first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick.
Oh i think i am a very good english speaker.
Everybody tells me i am very articulate.
Well i think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from new mexico to the east coast.
We also we lived in a very rural area in new mexico up in the mountains.
We lived in towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all.
So when we came here it was absolutely shocking.
I mean just the fact that they had sidewalks alone.
They just amazed us.
I think one thing that is different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money.
So a lot of times they are not going to pave these huge long roads all over the place.
It was just indescribable the impact that it had on us.
I think it took us years to really kind of overcome the culture shock.
So i i mean i remember that period of my life all the time.
What just the immense change that we underwent.
In fact we had spanish accents.
My parents always did their whole lives.
"But we had such a terrible time at school , people teasing us and everything."
We really tried hard to emulate english speakers especially.
I used to listen to david niven for some reason.
I wanted to sound like him.
"So you know it had a huge impact on us , each in their own way."
This little boy tommy found this ball.
So he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick.
Sure enough it went through the his neighbor's window.
His neighbor was watching television.
"Suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window , knocks over his lamp."
He looks out the window but there is nobody there.
There is tommy again.
His mother that morning knew that it was going to rain.
She would been listening to the weather channel.
She told him to take his umbrella.
No he is positive that there is not going to be any problem.
Also he does not want to look like a sissy with the umbrella.
He says goodbye to his mother.
About two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain.
So he runs back.
His mother's quite annoyed with him because she would argued with him.
He said it was not going to rain.
He feels bad.
The dog chased a a cat up into the tree.
Oh i guess it was actually her cat.
So she became quite upset about it.
Her neighbor came out and said.
I have a ladder.
I will get up there and get your cat.
So he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb.
The ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground.
Then he could not get down.
So somebody hadta call the fire department.
They came out and rescued the both of them.
I do not remember these animals.
I forgot what an involved story it is.
Cinderella lived with her father and her mother in this little village.
When she was very young her mother passed away.
At some point her father told her that he was going to remarry.
He met somebody there in their village.
He remarried.
Then sadly he passed away very shortly after that.
So she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters.
It they turned out that she was not very nice to cinderella.
So they turned her into a little maid.
She hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her stepsisters and her stepmother.
They pretty much just made her into a little servant.
But she did not really know what else to do.
There was nothing else she could do.
"Then they heard that there was going to be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son , the prince , who was."
They were trying to find a suitable bride for him.
So they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoi polloi of the area.
So the sisters decided they would go.
At first cinderella thought that she might go.
They laughed at her.
Told her she did not have anything to wear.
So they went to the ball.
"Her fairy godmother shows up , appears and tells her she will get it all set for the ball."
So she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses.
I forget what she made her dress out of.
So she goes to the ball.
Oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers.
So she goes to the ball.
She meets the prince.
The prince falls madly in love with her because she is the most beautiful girl there.
But the fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was.
So she saw midnight approaching.
So she hadta leave suddenly the prince.
"You know she hadta run away from him and hide , run away , jump in her carriage."
Just as she got back she jumped out of the carriage.
Everything turned back to what it was before.
So she thought.
Well that is going to be my one night of happiness.
But i will always remember it.
The way she was running out of the castle her glass slipper.
The prince had run been running around trying to find her.
That was the only thing he found was the glass slipper.
So he told his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper.
So they went around to all the villages.
They they had the women who might possibly be that cinderella try on the glass slipper.
So they got to the house of cinderella.
They asked her.
How many girls do you have?
No i only have two.
Bebecause they had found out what was going on.
They were having them try on this glass slipper.
So she forced cinderella to stay inside her room.
She they tried the slipper on to the the stepdaughters.
So the mother said.
No no that it will fit.
She took a knife and cut off part of the heel.
But it still did not fit.
They tried for the second woman.
The mother says.
No no it fits.
She cut off her toe in secret.
But it still did not fit.
So they said.
So then they were leaving.
Then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there.
I do not remember exactly who what clued them into that.
So they insisted on looking around.
They found cinderella.
Sure enough they tried her the shoe on her.
It fit.
So they took her back to the castle.
She married the prince.
She brought her sisters to live with them.
"Well when i make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, i toast the bread."
Then i let it cool off.
Then on one side i smear the peanut peanut butter.
Then on the other side i smear the jelly.
Then i put them together.
Well i have noone to talk yiddish to so i do not know whether i should include that.
Well i i can speak some yiddish.
But there is nobody to converse with so i do not know whether that would qualify.
"I have had so many happy memories , i do not even know where to start first."
I cannot think of anything outstanding.
I guess the day i got married.
When my children were born.
We were fortunate enough to have my parents babysit for the children so we could get away.
We went to jamaica for a week.
That was one of the most wonderful enjoyable vacations we ever had.
That was the only time that i remember crying the night before we hadta go home because i said.
I do not want to leave this place.
So i guess that is the one.
Well it is one thing to go with friends.
But it is another thing to go with a husband.
Is this supposed to be one story?
Or is each picture supposed to be a story?
Lo and behold the ball goes through a window and it breaks.
He is sitting here.
But that looks like another leg here.
"He is wondering , could his son have done that?"
He decides to go to the window and check.
There is nobody there.
So he does not know who to blame for this.
I do not know.
He said.
No it is not going to rain.
He insists upon going without the umbrella.
Lo and behold as he is walking it starts to rain.
His shoes get wet in the puddle.
He comes home drenched.
Now why have not you listened to me young man?
Do not you know that mothers know best?
"As a result of listening to his mother , the next time he goes out he takes the umbrella."
He is not getting wet.
For some reason dad has decided to climb up the tree.
Maybe he went to rescue the little pussy cat that was there because his daughter is quite upset that the cat is up on the tree and cannot get down.
Now the dog is barking because he would like dad to come down.
Somewheres along the line the fire engines come along.
Do we pacify the dog?
Do we take dad down?
Or do we rescue the cat first?
These firemen really have a big job on their hands.
I am just wondering who comes first.
Yeah i think so.
I do not remember who this man is.
Cinderella had a stepmother.
She did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just indulged themselves.
Then they announced that the the king would have a ball in the palace.
Everybody was invited.
She would have liked to have gone to the ball.
He said.
We will get you dressed up and get you to the ball.
She got into a beautiful gown and a a coach.
I am improvising.
Off she went to the ball.
The prince charming asked her to dance.
She danced with him.
I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother.
At the stroke of midnight cinderella knew she hadta return home.
So she quickly ran down the steps to get into the coach and in the process lost one of her slippers.
She got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters.
Well prince charming was enamored with her but he did not know who she was or where he could find her.
So he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball.
When they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into the shoe.
It would not work.
Cinderella they would not let cinderella do it.
However the prince or the attendants said.
Why do not we have this this young lady try on the shoe.
They finally did.
That is when the prince charming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball.
She went back to the palace.
The the king granted a marriage for his son prince charming and cinderella.
They were married.
They lived happily ever after.
Well i guess you would take two slices of white bread.
See that they the top one matches the bottom one.
The ability to tell a story like creative?
Will the pictures be making a picture and i will just tell you what it is?
I have such problems with that.
I have such problems creating stuff and tell it.
You know when somebody says like.
I went on a cruise.
"But i can only probably say i liked the food , something."
There is this child playing with this kickball or something.
Person sitting in his house probably does not have tv or something.
The ball comes in.
Then looks like he just looks out the window to see who there.
It looks like maybe she tried to give him an umbrella.
Yeah i think he bebecause he is out there he decided he did not want to take it.
He goes out and gets wet.
"I guess she looks like she is scolding him , i guess."
He is looking.
Then he takes the umbrella and goes.
It look like it did not start at the beginning.
It looks like that is what should have happened first.
I do not know why she is standing there with her hands up.
Alright anyway then i guess he goes up to get the cat down.
But it does not look like he is getting the cat down.
He is just sitting there.
I do not know.
I do not know.
Then finally i guess somebody calls the fire.
Yeah i guess.
I probably do not remember all of this.
I really do not remember all of this of cinderella.
Let me just say what i know about cinderella.
"She had these stepsisters , i think."
I think they made her do all the work.
According to that it looks like that animals were her friends.
I am not even sure how she got to go to the ball but she did.
And i think she was supposed to be back by midnight or then she turned into a pumpkin.
I do not remember that.
After that is kind of what i remember.
I i think she almost did not make it back.
But i think she did.
And i do not even remember all the stuff about meeting the prince.
But according to that you know some kind of way she married met the prince.
They got married.
I do not know.
I would have two pieces of bread.
I would put the peanut butter on one slice.
Let me see.
I have not made one lately.
But i think i would probably put jelly on the other slice.
I think i do fairly well.
I think very well.
I have done this in training so i i did not pull this one out of the air.
We had the first black president of collegename while you know i was in the post of this office.
So we invited him to meet the community.
I literally organized everything.
My father had a liquor store then.
I had the people in the liquor business contribute.
I think people smoked then.
Phillip morris contributed cigarettes.
I had the chemical bank contribute money and had all kinds of you know cheese.
It was one of the best events they have ever had at the school.
They have said that.
It was well attended by the whole community of collegename.
We did an instulement ceremony.
We did everything for this guy.
It is still one of the things i like best.
Even the president said.
I just did not want the job.
I did not realize i was going to do his work anyway.
So the little boy went out to play kickball that day.
It is a soccer ball i guess.
He never expected to when he kicked the ball that it went through somebody is window and broke it.
The gentleman who was in the house was shocked by the noise he heard.
He sees a ball coming.
He went to the window to find out who did this bebecause he was going to go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games.
Okay so then i hafta look at it so you do not hafta hear all my thoughts.
There is a mother getting ready to send her child off to school.
She tried to urge him to take an umbrella.
Obviously she is heard the weather report.
He went and he did not listen to his mother.
So he went out and got wet.
When he came back he looked very sad.
His mother looked very annoyed.
The next time he took an umbrella.
There is a whole lot going on here.
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside.
Oh there is a ladder so he was obviously trying to do.
Oh he was trying to get her cat and from the ladder.
He the ladder fell.
The dog is barking because everything's out of sorts for him.
"So the fire engine comes with a ladder , ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them."
I forgot all about this the wicked witch and her stepdaughters.
Okay you hid the text.
You do not want me to know the text.
Cinder means she is sweeping up the cinders from the chimney.
I do not remember this.
They are talking about how there is some young lady they have never seen before.
I do not really remember.
I do not really remember it too well.
The sisters do not want her to go.
Is not that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly?
Then the fairy godmother helps her go.
She captures the eye of the prince charming.
She hasta leave before midnight.
He does not know where she is.
Her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin.
The wicked godmother locks her in.
But then they bring the key.
They take the key to the cellar.
"They try every maiden in the town, whatever they call those old things, parish, to see who the shoe belongs to."
It belongs to cinderella.
She is living with the wicked stepmother.
I guess it is her stepmother.
I do not know where her father is.
The stepmother has these two not attractive daughters.
"Cinderella , she is very pretty but she is left in tatters and rags."
Her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the you know the cinders from the whatever.
The fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor.
So one day there was going to be a ball.
She wants to go as well as her daughters.
But they are figuring whom you you know.
Other rats will be your coachmen i think.
She gets her a great dress or something to wear.
"Her hair , they do not even talk about all that."
So she goes.
The prince is dancing with all the young ladies but she captures his eye.
He dances with her.
She realizes at the stroke of midnight she hasta be home.
So she runs out there before he can find out who she is.
In running she drops one of her slippers.
She runs into the coach which turns into a pumpkin before she can get home i think.
The coachmen turn into rats and whatever.
So the the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to.
He is going to go to every house and see if the shoe fits.
The fairy godmother she is trying to get her daughters their big feet into the shoes.
No it does not work.
They say.
We see this young lady.
But it is her you know.
It is so she sits down.
They the shoe fits perfectly.
He knows he is found his princess.
He whisks her off.
They get married.
They live happily ever after.
How i would make it?
I would probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something.
So i would go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out.
Go to the refrigerator where i also keep my bread.
I would open them there.
I would take the peanut butter first.
I like a lot of food.
Then i would take the jelly and put that on over top of the peanut butter still on the same side.
I would take the other side and put it down.
Then i would take it and cut it in half.
Then i would start eating it.
I speak pretty well i think.
It was getting towards.
I realized when i got down there that i was an hour early.
Dc sets up a a kind of a christmas bazaar down on g street?
I guess it is g street.
They had closed the street to traffic.
There were wonderful little kiosks along the street with really nice stuff.
I was kind of cold so i bought a wool beret.
Then i felt fine.
I walked around.
I was walking up seventh street.
Up ahead of me on the right in descending letters it said regal cinema.
Just across the street was another sign also descending that said legal seafood.
I make up a story?
Okay we have got a a a perfectly okay little boy playing with a soccer ball.
He kicks it.
"It goes through the window of the house , probably his own house."
"It breaks the window, knocks over a lamp, and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father."
"Who then picks up the ball, stares out the window, and probably swears little boy."
This little boy does not want to take an umbrella to school.
You can tell he is going to school because he is got his backpack on.
His mother's trying to give him the umbrella.
He is saying.
He walks out the door and waves goodbye.
It starts raining on him.
He runs home.
He is soaking wet.
His mother is frowning at him.
The next thing you see is him with walking with an umbrella.
The cat went up the tree.
The little girl wants her kitty cat down.
The father clearly tried to go up the tree and get it.
He got up there.
The ladder fell.
Cinderella's father married for the second time when cinderella's mother had died.
He married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters.
"Then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her clean the fireplaces , hence the name cinderella."
So they cooked up a scheme to have a ball.
They sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality.
Cinderella got one but she of course did not think she could go because she did not have the clothes or even transportation.
But then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with white horses and a footman and so forth.
But the provision was she must must leave at midnight.
She went to the ball.
The prince danced with her and basically fell in love.
Midnight came.
She suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be out of there.
So she hurried away.
In her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her.
She was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth.
But she managed to get home anyway.
He had fallen in love with this woman.
She had disappeared.
All he had left was a glass slipper.
He refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else.
"So the his father , who i guess was the king , and the minister of marriages went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on."
Of course it would not fit anyone at all including the two unpleasant stepsisters.
Even though i believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit try to fit in.
But it still did not work.
It got blood all over the place.
But finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper.
But he insisted that she try it on.
Sure enough it fit.
So he had found his bride.
There was great celebration throughout the land.
They got married and lived happily ever after.
But i i would take two pieces of bread.
I would put peanut butter on one using a knife.
I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread.
Then i would put the two together.
I would probably slice it.
Bebecause it would be for a kid i would probably slice it in quarters.
I have given several speeches.
Oh there is so many.
What kind of a story do you want to hear?
Well there one interesting time trying to map malaria in ethiopia and trying to find out why our program not working.
We had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms.
They looked like an army.
They would go from village to village spraying up everything in sight.
So i went out looking for answers.
On this one occasion i drove for across this desert area for musta been six hours.
I would been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark.
I am getting a little concerned.
I was also warned about the danakil people also called afars.
Very no i do not think you would call it hostile.
But they did not have many friends because their their the way they qualify for marriage.
They had these mass weddings that were made.
The way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body.
"So after about six hours we happened upon this little group of tuples , round mud houses."
We stopped the landrover.
We were surrounded by about twenty guys.
The minute i saw them i knew they were afars.
I thought.
"It turned out that about a third of the community , maybe more , were down with malaria."
They assumed that i was a physician because they would the only white people they had seen before were physicians.
Just by sheer accident i had a car full of medication.
At the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy.
Suddenly the chief appeared.
He ordered them to bring up what i was told was the ceremony for honored guests.
I said.
They said.
I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days.
I said.
You have been doing fine up until now firstnamej.
So we had smoked camel's milk.
It really works.
I kept asking for seconds and thirds.
The chief got a big smile on his face.
It all ended well.
I do not know whether this is in your interview or not.
But at my age i very often forget the word that i want to say.
It is getting a little worse.
Well the dad sends the son out to get a little exercise.
He finds the soccer ball ending in his lap.
He looks out there and he says.
Oh this reminds me of my childhood.
Mom wants son to take an umbrella with him.
He says.
I do not need that.
He comes home drenching wet.
Mother says.
I told you so.
Son has learned a lesson.
Girl's girl's cat has crawled up into the tree.
The dad says.
Well i will go fetch it.
Why is the dog barking?
I do not know.
Possibly because there is a man in the tree.
In the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder.
Somebody called for help.
This goes way back.
Wow i do not remember this version.
These first two pages i do not remember at all.
This is going to be tough to remember.
Something missing here.
I do not remember that part.
I do not remember those first two pages.
But i gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who lives on an estate.
I do not know.
Is that the way the story goes?
"Well as i recall , cinderella and and her sisters were all workers in this estate."
The others treated her badly.
"She always got the worst tasks to perform , and longed for a different life."
"I do not remember the bit about the key , her."
Her sister locks her in the room.
I do not know.
Well that comes a little later.
A fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because she is been such a good person.
The arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight.
At the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her.
But then hasta flee on schedule to avoid the being converted back into a chambermaid.
"The handsome gentleman , upon upon discovering the shoe , determines he is going to look for a person that that that fits."
The evil sisters are determined it is going to be one of them.
So that must be where the key comes in.
They lock her room.
I do not recall how she gets out.
But at any rate it is eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits.
Everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters.
Well i usually put almond butter on one slice of bread and and jelly on the other and fold it.
I am doing very well thank you.
Sure happy memory when i got married and when i had children.
Sad memory when my father passed away.
We have been married for twenty four years.
We are living in cityname maryland.
I would first get the peanut butter out of the cabinet.
I would get the jelly out of the refrigerator.
I would take them back over to the counter.
"I would pull out a plate, come over and get a knife, then go over and get the bread out of the bread bin."
I would put the peanut butter on first one slice and then the jelly on the other.
I see a boy out on the field.
He is kicking a soccer ball.
The boy is kicking the ball into the air.
It seems like the ball is in the second picture going through the window of a house.
But it is breaking the window and going inside.
To the third picture where there is a gentleman who is sitting in a chair.
But it breaks through the window.
The ball comes right at him.
The man in the picture seems to be a lot older.
He going into the fourth frame picks the ball up and looks out the broken window to to see if he could see who kicked the ball through the window.
I see a a lady and a smaller child.
"I do not know if it is a mother , daughter."
The lady is holding an umbrella.
They seem to be talking.
In the second it seems to be a little girl but not sure.
"The second frame , they seem to be continuing the discussion."
The older lady seems to be holding the umbrella and listening to the child.
It seems like the child is discussing the fact that he or she does not need the umbrella.
The child goes out into the outside in frame three.
He or she notices it is starting to rain.
He or she puts her hand out and feels the raindrops.
This child's going somewhere bebecause there is a backpack on his or her shoulder.
In frame four the rain is coming down a lot harder.
The child is panicking and turns the other way and puts their hand over their head and is running presumably back to the house.
In frame five the little boy or girl meets the lady again.
I am presuming it is the mom.
He is soaking wet.
The mother presumably gives the child an umbrella.
The child goes back outside in the rain with the umbrella open and goes off to wherever they are going.
Along with the man in the tree there is a cat and a bird.
There is a dog at the base of the tree barking up.
There is a little girl underneath the branch where the cat is sitting.
To the right of the tree the two fire men are bringing a ladder presumably to rescue the cat from the tree which the older gentleman seems to be trying to rescue.
The little girl is very upset because she thinks the cat is endangered.
Okay cinderella was a young lady who lived with her two stepsisters and stepmother.
They treated her very badly and made her do a lot of work.
One day a gentleman came to their house and announced that there would be a ball that the king was having for the prince to find a princess for the prince.
Cinderella thought she was going.
But her mother stepmother said.
No she is not going.
Just the two other sisters were going.
They got ready to go to the ball and left.
As cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses.
They went to the ball.
But the fairy godmother said.
You hafta be home by twelve of the clock or everything will disappear at twelve of the clock.
So she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time.
The prince fell in love with her at the ball.
It was just about twelve of the clock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes crystal shoes at the ball.
She barely made it home.
The prince wanted to find her.
Took the shoe and made a decree that they would check every girl in the village until cinderella was found.
They came to the house.
Her two stepsisters they tried the shoe on but it would not fit.
They finally found cinderella.
They put the shoe on cinderella.
It fit!
Cinderella was reunited with the prince.
They got married and lived happily ever after.
Then their childhood and all the antics that go with that.
He kicks the ball.
It goes through his neighbor's window into the neighbor's family room where the neighbor is sitting there watching television.
It goes right in to where the neighbor is sitting.
The neighbor is jumping up.
He jumps up to find out where that soccer ball came from.
He looks out into the yard to see who kicked the soccer ball.
Okay little johnny is getting ready to go off to school.
As he is getting ready to walk out the door his mother says.
He tells his mother.
I do not need an umbrella.
He says.
I do not want an umbrella.
He gets outside.
He is walking.
It starts to rain.
It rains harder and harder and harder.
So he turns around.
He runs home and goes inside.
He is drenched.
His mother asks him.
He says.
I need my umbrella.
So then she gives him the umbrella.
He takes it and goes out back outside in the rain where he is not going to get wet anymore.
But i believe he has changed his clothes first before he goes back outside bebecause he goes outside dry.
He stays dry with the umbrella.
Everything i see.
Fluffy the cat has been chased up the tree by the family dog.
"Little lucy , whose cat it is , sees her cat up in the tree and tells her dad who comes out and climbs up into the tree with a ladder."
But the ladder falls down.
The firemen come to help get the cat out of the tree and her dad out of the tree.
So the firemen have arrived.
There is help that is come to help get the cat out of the tree.
So i can use details even though there were no pictures about them.
This woman had two daughters.
So cinderella came to live with her father and her stepmother and two stepsisters.
Then her father passed away.
She was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters.
She became like a housekeeper for them.
She did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked.
And they treated mistreated her.
"So one day there was a ball given by the king and queen to find a suitable wife for their son, the prince."
So the invitation came.
"But poor cinderella, she could not go."
She did not have the clothes.
Her stepmother and stepsisters said she was not invited to the king's ball.
So she she wished she could go to the ball.
But she had no way to do that.
"So the night of the ball , the stepsisters get to go to the ball."
They are all dressed up.
Out the door they go.
She is crying.
All of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and asks why she is crying.
She says she wished she could go to the ball.
So the fairy godmother said that she could.
Fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into carriage drivers.
She had horses for the carriage.
She casts the spell.
Cinderella has a beautiful dress.
She has a beautiful dress.
She says.
You will go to the ball.
But one one rule is that at twelve of the clock midnight you must be home by twelve of the clock because all of this magic is going to go away.
Cinderella goes off to the ball.
She gets there.
The prince becomes smitten with her when he sees her.
He is dancing with her.
Her stepsisters are just seething because girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with?
They wanted to be chosen by the prince.
The night is going wonderfully.
Then she hears the clock strike twelve.
She remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken.
She runs out and down the stairs leaving the prince behind.
As she is running down the stairs one of her glass slippers comes off.
Because when the fairy godmother cast the spell she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing.
She runs home.
She she gets home before you know as the spell is being broken.
He wonders who this beautiful woman was.
He wants to find throughout the kingdom who this woman is.
So he finds the glass slipper on the steps.
Knows it belongs to her.
He sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper.
Who does that shoe belong to?
So they go throughout the kingdom trying the glass slipper on all of these women.
Noone can wear the glass slipper.
It fits noone.
So they finally get to the house where cinderella is living.
They are keeping her in the basement because they know that the prince is coming.
"They do not want her out you know out and about , where she could talk with him."
He tries the glass slipper on her two sisters.
It does not fit.
He is wondering.
Is there anyone else that you know this shoe could fit?
So cinderella they realize that cinderella is there.
The prince's assistant asks for her to try on the shoe.
She tries the shoe on.
He takes that news back to the prince.
He realizes she is the the young lady that he was smitten with.
They live happily ever after.
So they live happily ever after.
I would get a loaf of bread.
I would remove two slices of bread from the loaf of bread.
I would open the peanut butter jar and take peanut butter on a knife and spread it across the bread.
Then i would spread open the jelly and spread jelly on top of the peanut butter.
Then take the second slice of bread and put it on top of the first slice that has the peanut butter and jelly on it.
"I have been speaking since , i guess , the normal age."
When do kids start to speak?
I have been reading pretty young.
I have learned sort of selftaught myself to read when i was about four.
So i was reading pretty well by kindergarten.
"My speech is , i think , fluent and generally understandable."
I talk a little fast sometimes.
See now you make me want to think of a really good story.
Well i have told you about my mom.
Okay i will tell you a story.
This is a story about an event that i am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird.
But it is so clear in my mind and it still does not make any sense.
So my first two years of college i went to universityname in cityname.
I had a car.
So i would drive back and forth over break time with my car.
So it generally takes about two days.
"So the first semester back , it is winter and i am driving across i eighty which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn."
There is a lot of you know driver tunnel vision that happens.
But i am i am kind of proud of myself because it is my first semester went well.
"I was you know independent , excited."
There is a slowdown.
It is very flat so i can see ahead.
I do not see that there is construction.
I do not really see an accident.
"But i you know figure something is happened , probably a minor accident."
It looks like it is a rubbernecking delay.
"There is no exits , nothing , built along it."
We get closer and closer and closer.
I still cannot see what is going on.
We get a little closer.
I see okay it looks like i am in the left lane.
Then there is a median between the you know east bound and west bound routes.
I am going east.
I can see that there is something over in the median to my left.
"It looks , as i get closer , like an animal."
I get closer.
It looks like a fairly large animal.
I am thinking.
I mean there would not be a moose in illinois.
But fairly large and there is something unusual about it.
So i am a little more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay.
Why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal?
I just want to get home.
I get closer and i can see that there is these kind of large hind legs.
So it is oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car.
There is kind of a long tail.
I am getting closer and closer and closer.
"I you know my mind is doing that thing where it is just trying to do the pattern matching , going."
"As i am passing it , my head is."
You know we are just creeping along.
It is only until it is at my shoulder and i passed it that it my mind kind of pattern matches and goes.
Then you know again i hafta turn around and look at the road.
Everything's cleared up behind me.
I spent like the next five miles going.
I saw the ears.
I saw the big massive tail.
I saw the big hind legs.
I saw the little tiny front legs.
So to this day it is this thing where i just do not know.
I just do not know.
I mean this was.
"Google was around but there were not really , if you did not know how to search."
I think i have subsequently every now and then done like kangaroo roadkill kind of to see if there is information about this but no.
I just do not know how.
I mostly just kind of like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going.
It does not have a neat little conclusion.
I do not know.
I do not know.
Nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo.
I mean it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind i mean massive hind feet.
I do not know what else it possibly could have been.
"I mean basically if it is not a dog or a cow or a deer , it is something that should not be there."
Okay what am i looking at?
Alright so there is a little boy named ralph.
His dad is always on ralph's back about you know.
Yeah you got to participate in a team sport.
You know it is fine if you like science and you want to become an astronaut.
But you know you still got to learn some skills.
So here i bought you this soccer ball so that you can you know.
All you hafta do is run around.
Let us go out and practice.
So ralph whines and whines and whines.
His dad says.
Listen if you do not do this then i am going to hafta severely restrict your internet time to get you to be a wellrounded kid.
So finally ralph goes outside.
He is practicing with the soccer ball.
He he cannot quite get it.
"He keeps doing the charlie brown thing , running up to it , missing , almost falling down."
Finally finally finally he kicks it.
It arcs high.
He sees it.
"It goes toward the house , toward the house , toward the house , into the living room."
"Ralph's dad , we will call him jake , looks up."
The soccer ball comes in and it knocks over this lamp.
He hates the lamp.
He gets up he he walks over to the the window.
He looks out.
I was just practicing.
Can i use the internet now?
The dad jake sighs and is like.
Yeah you can use the internet.
He gives up at that point on ever making his son wellrounded and decides his son will just be the best damn astronaut that ever there was.
There is a mom.
We will call her sally.
There is a kid.
We will call him andre.
Sally has bought andre a really really ugly umbrella.
Andre refuses to use it.
He gives it back.
He says to his mom.
I am going to go out.
It is going to be fine.
I do not think there is going to be rain.
"I saw , on our local news , my favorite meteorologist said there is no way there is going to be rain."
So you keep your ugly umbrella.
If it does rain i will come back and you get to say that you were right.
"So of course little andre , did i say , goes out into the weather."
It immediately starts raining.
He thinks.
"That meteorologist , i am going to hafta start watching channel nine instead of channel seven."
He runs back inside.
He looks at his mom and he goes.
Mom says.
Well i told you so.
You told me i could tell you so.
Little andre goes out.
He is got his umbrella.
He just thinks.
Well i guess i am a channel nine viewer now.
There is a little girl jenny.
She has a cat named moggy.
Moggy she is trying to play dressup with moggy.
Moggy gets very upset.
He manages to dash out of the door where he encounters the dog named goldie.
Goldie starts barking at moggy.
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard.
Meanwhile little girl jenny runs after them.
She starts yelling and yelling and yelling.
The cat will not come down.
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder and tries to to carry it.
She is dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up.
He sees her out the window and starts yelling.
"So the dad comes , grabs the ladder , sits it against the tree , climbs up it to try to get moggy."
As he is climbing up the tree goldie the dog knocks the ladder over.
Poor dad is stuck in the tree.
She runs back to the house.
She calls the nineoneone.
On her way back she grabs her tricycle and tricycles out to the tree just to you know save time.
All this time the the fire department comes out.
They rescue dad.
They rescue moggy after a lot of difficulty.
"This whole time this little bird is just singing , enjoying the show."
Well i remember cinderella but i will give it a first shot.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named ella.
She was the daughter of two loving parents.
"Only one day when she is a little girl , her mother dies suddenly."
Everybody cries.
Everybody loved her mother.
"Her father , in his grief and in his worry about cinderella having a mom , goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own."
He brings them all home to his lovely manor where they immediately take a dislike to cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps.
At this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn cinderella basically into a skivvy.
"They make her run around working all the time , then begin mocking her for being dirty."
They call her cinderella.
So one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people.
Or perhaps he is commanded to hold a ball.
He will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match.
They spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns.
Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to you know get out of the house and to have a bit of glamour.
But of course they will not let her.
Because they they tell her that she would be an embarrassment.
But mostly they do not want the competition.
So they go off to the ball.
Cinderella is left alone sort of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house.
She begins crying.
She is crying and crying by the fireplace when all of a sudden a woman materializes from the flames and says.
Cinderella why are you crying?
Cinderella says.
I just wanted one night of happiness and joy.
The woman says.
Well i am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this.
So can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs?
You are already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do.
She waves her wand.
The pumpkin turns into a carriage.
"Her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown , and her slippers into slippers of cut glass."
You know none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling.
She turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen.
Cinderella is just overcome with joy.
She gets into the carriage.
She is about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says.
"At midnight when chimes go , everything will turn back."
So make sure that you are well away from the ball out of you know an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens.
So cinderella says.
She goes off to the ball.
She arrives.
It is even more dazzling than she thought.
She comes in.
Everybody is just enchanted with her because she is beautiful and charming.
In the midst of of her being greeting throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up.
He sees her.
He asks her to dance.
They begin to dance.
Of course they are both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they would have really cute kids together.
The clock begins to strike twelve.
She says.
Oh no oh yeah i need to go.
She she runs off.
He is thinking.
There is a lady running away from me?
So she gets a good head start.
"Even though she is wearing heels of glass she runs out of the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach , the prince chasing after her all the while."
On the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes.
She does not have time to stop and pick it up.
She leaps into the coach.
It starts racing out of the palace grounds down the road as the clock you know slowly strikes midnight.
On the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and and her clothes back into rags.
She hasta run the rest of the way home.
"He did not have a coach at the ready , you know being in his own palace and all."
But he has the shoe.
He looks at the shoe.
He thinks.
I have a clue.
I shall not rest until i find this woman because truly she is the hottest lady i have ever seen.
It is got to be her.
So he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest but still a kingdom.
It does not fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason.
Finally he gets the manor house where cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother.
He tries the shoe on the first stepsister.
It does not fit.
He tries it on the second stepsister.
It does not fit.
He just has a sense.
He has a sense.
He says.
I do not know.
She is kind of dirty but she looks kind of hot.
I do not remember if she is as hot as the lady i saw last night but let us give it a go.
So he calls her over.
You do not want anything to do with her.
You know they are they might not be your first choice but they are a pretty good second bet.
The prince continues to wave her away.
He approaches cinderella.
He asks her to try on the shoe.
She does.
Of course it fits.
He thinks.
He whisks her away.
They marry.
Depending on your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters.
Possibly they just feel really bad.
Supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after.
Well if you live in an industrialized nation with a lot of premade foods.
Let us assume that.
I am not going to make the bread from scratch or grow the peanuts.
"You would go to the grocery store, purchase bread, whatever kind of bread that you like."
"If it is not already been sliced you would need to slice it at home or have it sliced at the grocery store or bakery, wherever you prefer."
Again if you want to buy you know your organic custom ground at whole foods you can do that.
Or you could just get you know your jar of generic jif from giant.
There is very little difference between the two.
I am sure somebody could tell you.
You need a plate.
"Then in order to avoid cross contamination , clean the knife."
Put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing each other.
Then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across.
Well i used to play rugby.
"So the first time i scored my first try, first goal in the game."
We were playing a round robin tournament out in salem massachusetts which was about an hour and half from our school.
We would all got in different cars.
We would had an hour and a half trip through boston to get there.
We were playing in what must have been a new field because it was surrounded by new newer buildings.
Round robin means there are three teams basically.
We were each playing each other basically throughout the tournament.
It it did not last very long.
So we we show up.
We play the first game.
We get beat.
This was my sophomore year i think.
"So they decided to start putting in less experienced players, me self and several of my friends onto the field and onto the team."
So the first try i scored was i think in the second game.
I think we were actually playing salem themselves.
I do not remember what the other team name was.
I am pretty sure we were playing salem.
"Basically what happened was our fly, who was on the back line, got in a breakaway run."
So he is running forward.
They have two members of their back line going out to tackle him and get him down to try and take the ball back.
So there are two of them.
I could probably beat them in a rough.
But i did not want to try it because they were faster than me.
I was also far enough away where i was not sure i could get to it before they could because they were already on top of him.
So he looked back.
Later on i found out he did not even know who was behind him.
He was just throwing it to get rid of it and hope that someone on the team was there.
I happened to be there.
So they both tackled him instead of leaving one guy up to take care of the hurricane behind him.
So i got the ball a good five feet back.
Then i just sprinted across the line and touched it down to get the try.
So that was the first try i ever got.
"After his family, hundreds of times have told him to play with it in in the backyard, he is playing with it in the side yard next to his neighbor mister anderson's house."
"Now timmy, being a uncareful eight year old, kicks the ball over the fence, over the bushes, and into mister anderson's window, knocking mister anderson's lamp over and depositing the ball right into mister anderson's waiting lap as he watches television."
"Now mister anderson, being a bit perturbed that a ball that had just came sailing through his window, stands up, looks out the window, and tries to find where little timmy just ran off to."
"His mom, claire, offers umbrella, telling him that it is most likely going to rain on his way to school."
He does not care about the rain.
It will not rain on him because it looks so nice out.
"Now halfway on his way to school, it does start raining on his head."
He gets about three quarters of the way before it starts pouring.
He has to turn around and run back because he knows it is supposed to pour all day because his mom told him it was going to rain.
She also told him it was sposta rain all day.
So now he wants that umbrella.
He runs home.
His mom with a slight look of disappointment says i told you so with her eyes.
He retrieves the umbrella from the closet his mom had put it back in.
"He continues his way on to school slightly soggy, but more dry than he would have been otherwise."
So one day alicia was riding by on her tricycle.
"She noticed that her cat, mister tibs, had gotten stuck up in a tree."
She was calling for help because it is a very tight knit neighborhood where they live.
He told her that since his house was only a good thirty feet away he could run and go get a ladder to go up into the tree to get the cat down and asked if she could look after his dog while he went and did so.
So she held onto the dog while she watched the cat.
"He went back and got a ladder , climbed up the tree and very very soon after which the ladder fell down, stranding him and the cat in the tree."
Now he tells alicia to go phone the fire department to get them both down from the tree.
"In doing so, she let us the dog go."
The dog barks up the tree for its owner who unfortunately cannot jump down to meet it.
Do you want me to tell the entire story of cinderella?
I i will look at the pictures first.
So there once was a young girl named cinderella.
She lived alone with her father who one day married an evil stepmother.
Although she did not know she was evil at the time.
Now the stepmother and the stepsisters treated cinderella very poorly.
"They made her do all the cleaning up, all the washing even though the family was fairly well off and could afford to hire servants."
So that left her alone to the mercy of her evil stepmother and stepsisters.
Now cinderella grew close to the animals that her family owned the horses the mice not technically owned by her family but living in the house and the birds of the forest and could get them to help her with the chores every now and then.
One day cinderella found out that her family was going to the prince's ball.
She wanted nothing more but to accompany them to it.
She took her time and made her own dress to go with her family because her stepmother and stepsisters would not allow her to be provided one.
"Upon learning that she had planned to do this, her stepmother and her stepsisters tore the dress from her."
Tore tore into it and made it unserviceable to go to the ball with.
Now after her stepsisters and stepmother had left to go to the ball a fairy godmother came to cinderella and told her that she could help her get to the ball on time and charm the handsome prince.
"To do this, she transformed a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice, the horses and the birds into appropriate helpers for cinderella."
She also gave her a beautiful white dress and a pair of glass slippers.
"She however, told cinderella that cinderella had to be back by midnight or else the magic would wear off."
Now cinderella went to the ball and had a fabulous time.
She was noticed by everyone upon entering including the prince.
The prince asked her to dance.
He was going to dance with her over the two stepsisters.
Neither of them recognized her somehow.
She enjoyed her dance with the prince so much that she lost track of time.
Just before it hit twelve she noticed that the time was about to be up.
So she ran from him without explanation.
"He chased after her, down the steps of the palace."
She tripped and stumbled out of one of her glass slippers and kept running.
The prince stopped and picked it up knowing that he could never catch up to her as it were.
"She managed to just escape the castle before the magic wore off, leaving her back to looking like plain old cinderella."
She went back to her house thinking that would be the end of it.
Now the prince had been mightily charmed by her and decided that he was to find the mystery woman he had danced with at the ball that night.
So he took the glass slipper that he had procured from her.
He went around the kingdom trying it on different women's feet.
He eventually arrived at cinderella's house and attempted to fit the glass slipper on both of the evil stepdaughters which did not work because their feet were either too large or too small.
"Now the stepmother, being a bit smarter than the stepsisters, had worked out who the mystery girl at the palace had been by this point."
"So upon the prince demanding to try the shoe on cinderella, even after the protestations of the stepmother and the stepdaughters that it could not have been her for she was just a lowly servant girl, the stepmother trips the carrier of the glass slipper shattering it."
Now the prince thinks all is lost.
"But cinderella chimes in and brings out the pair, the other glass slipper, that she had kept."
She puts it on in front of the prince.
The prince knows at once that it is the pair of the shoe that he had had.
That cinderella was the girl he danced with at the ball the night before.
He married her.
They lived happily ever after.
Let us see.
I watched beauty and the beast a lot as well.
I sang the gaston song a whole lot.
It is a fun song to sing.
"Other than that, i would probably would say the most watched one for me would be lion king."
I have not seen it no.
I have not seen any of the live action movies.
I i just do not see how they could live up to the animated versions because they are classic.
I i think they would probably be better better advised to spend their resources on other newer animated movies.
"Or if they want to do live action movies, other movies and other scripts."
They are doing it at prescott park right now.
Are we to assume that we have the ingredients prepared?
So we do not need to grow the wheat to make the.
So you start with a loaf of whole wheat or white bread or what whatever bread you would like.
The whole wheat and white are generally the two that you would want to go with for peanut butter and jelly.
You would start with your preferred jar of jelly and your preferred jar of peanut butter.
You would lay out two slices of your preferred bread.
"Then you would take one knife, dip it into the peanut butter and slather one side of the bread with peanut butter."
Then you would take another knife so as not to cross contaminate your jelly with peanut butter or vice versa.
Then you would take out one knife's worth of jelly and spread it over the other side of the bread.
Then you bring the two sides of the bread together.
Then from there you can use either knife at this point because there is no need to bring a third knife into this.
I mean you are already cross contaminating the sandwich itself to cut the sandwich however you desire and or cut the crusts off.
So there is so many i could choose from.
So i do not know.
I i think it is so.
I will i will just tell this story because i i told one of my coworkers this recently too.
My my brother had recently just gotten out of an eight year relationship.
They were living together.
I also had gotten out of a relationship of about two years a month prior.
Let us go.
I was living in iowa at the time.
He lives with my family in illinois.
So he came and visited me at school.
So we are we went to this beercade.
We are just you know having beer.
"We are just playing some games, just hanging out, having a good time."
He comes up to me and was like.
Hey i want you to introduce me to your new guy.
Bebecause they also knew each other too.
So they had classes together.
So but then i went up to my my partner.
Hey so he for whatever reason wants to meet you.
I you know i do not see the point in that.
I do not know why he is trying to be a big man.
I during this conversation i then see that my ex is talking with my brother.
My brother comes up to me.
He does not say.
How is it going?
He literally walks up to him.
What why why cannot we have nice things?
So i realized at after that night that i had made the right decision in breaking up with him if that is how he is going to treat both my family and friends and people that i am around.
You know what?
I did the right thing for myself.
But it is important to me just because it helped my brother and i get grow closer together bebecause we were talking through everything that when he was saying and the circumstances.
We it is it prompted a two hour heart to heart about where where we are at and everything.
I do not know.
Yeah that was just the first thing that came to mind.
So there was a little boy playing soccer in his yard.
When he went to do a kick he accidentally kicked it the soccer ball in through a window where an older gentleman was just sitting there on his recliner trying to enjoy his day off of work.
He is looking out through the hole.
I am assuming the that there is going to be some repercussions.
So the mother is insisting to her child to take the umbrella before he leaves for school.
He for whatever reason decides.
No i do not need an umbrella.
So when he is walking to school he gets very very very much so rained on.
When he gets home to his mother she is like.
Hey i offered you that umbrella.
The next time he goes for a walk in the rain he learned his lesson and used the umbrella.
The ladder fell.
Or actually i am i am going to restart this over.
So so this guy noticed that a little girl's cat was in the tree.
So he decided to come and bring his ladder and try to retrieve the cat.
But when he was trying to retrieve the cat his ladder fell.
So now there is both a cat and a man stuck in the tree.
So the fire department hadta come and get them both down.
All the while the man's dog is very unhappy bebecause he cannot get to him.
Yeah i feel like the walt disney cinderella is a little bit better.
I will just look at the pretty pictures real quick.
So they all came together as one.
I cannot even say happy family.
They came together as a family.
Cinderella was outcasted immediately by the stepmother and the two sisters.
So as as she grew older she was stuck with doing the worst tasks around the house.
Really her dad was not around very often to kind of make to to stop the kind of treatment that the the stepmom and stepsisters were putting her through.
But they received word that that the prince in town was going to have a ball and find a female suitor.
So the stepsisters got all dolled up for it and said told cinderella that she could not go.
But then cinderella encountered her fairy godmother?
Otherwise the spells would wear off.
So when clock was about to strike midnight she was dancing with the prince and having a wonderful time.
But she had to take off.
When she was running away to beat the clock she left one of her glass slippers on the stairs.
The prince so begotten by cinderella went through a full survey of the entire kingdom to try to find who would fit into the glass slipper.
And of course when he got to cinderella's house the stepsisters were very shocked by the fact that it fit her because they did not even know that she was going to be at the ball.
But and she married him and lived happily ever after.
Did you see the live action beauty and the beast?
I really liked it.
I thought it was good.
Whenever they do live action things i get very wary.
But it was one that i thought was actually pretty cute and done well.
It had to be original.
Yeah it has a lot of big names in it.
So i do not know if that is why it is been getting so much hype.
I have not seen it.
But i do not know if i will waste.
I do not know if i will see it while it is in theaters or wait yet.
But i have not decided.
So i start by taking the bread out laying it on plate or surface.
I get my jar of jelly and a knife.
I make sure to use the jelly first because then when i have i am done applying the jelly i can wipe off the jelly knife which you cannot do that with the peanut butter.
Then i do do peanut butter after the jelly.
Then make i probably put two tablespoons of peanut butter but which is more than most people.
Oh and sometimes i cut it diagonally too because it makes me feel fancy.
I think the single most important thing that ever happened to me in my life was that i was driving home from a graduate school class on i forty outside of knocksville tennesse.
I had two high school aged children at home.
There were semi tractor trailer trucks going by.
All i could think of was.
What will happen to them if i do not make it home?
Then i had i guess what would be considered to be a mystic experience from letting go.
I have no idea who drove the car.
I have no idea how long things passed.
But i all of a sudden saw complete and total knowledge.
Everything made perfect sense.
From that point forward i understood that life was good.
I do not recommend doing it while driving in a storm with trucks.
But i have now since then had glimpses of that dimension or that brain condition so many times that i am slowly relearning.
It is considered a mystical experience similar to what people have when they do a near death experience.
It added to my resilience from my childhood traumas.
Oh so i just do this.
You want.
Okay so once upon a time there was a young boy i think playing ball by himself.
He accidentally sent the ball into the window which involved a parental unit.
The good part about the story is that instead of being angry about the broken window the parental unit went outside with the ball with the child.
That made for a good day.
Well it is going to be a play day.
The child's going to be going to school.
The mom's worried and offering an umbrella which the child is not particularly excited about.
So he goes outside without the umbrella and starts to get wet.
Of course that means he is going to be in trouble.
In the old days before somebody invented an umbrella it would have been an opportunity.
"He would have been allowed to take a shower and get his hair clean, wash his clothes, and come back and be not in trouble but be awarded for having interacted with weather which useta be a normal thing."
He tried to explain this to his mother.
But she did not buy it because in her brain she was going to hafta do the laundry.
She sent him back out with the proper gear.
But he had much more fun in the rain when he did not have the umbrella.
Well once upon a place in the world of trees there was a child who wanted her cat to feel like a hero.
So she asked her father if he could climb up the tree so the cat could save him because she knew that this would be a braver cat if it had some success in its life.
So the father climbed up into the tree and threw the ladder away.
The little girl threw the cat up into the tree.
But the cat decided to take a nap.
Meanwhile the dog was jealous because the dog wanted attention too.
So the dog started barking and barking and barking at the dad to get down.
The cat was listening to the bird that was singing.
This bird was singing so loud that it sounded like alarms.
So firemen came.
Firemen came and ran straight to the house.
They did not see a fire.
They were running so fast they did not see the man or the cat.
So the dog got credit for calling the fire department.
The little girl asked the dad to jump back down.
I have.
I cannot believe we did this to little girls.
"Because he was invested in doing right by his daughter, he decided to partner with a woman who had girls, thinking that more girls would make for a better household."
But there was contention from the getgo.
The mother of the girls treated cinderella like a maid.
It was somebody that she could use as a servant while her girls had lessons and got dresses made.
Who knows where the man was.
He was not paying attention.
So cinderella hadta have friends with mice crickets and whatever all.
Then the community decided to have a ball because they had a prince that needed a woman.
So everybody was going to go to the ball except cinderella bebecause she is the cleaning girl.
Cinderella knows how to manifest.
So she manifests this fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother has a wand.
She is going to create a dress and wonderful glass slippers for the girl.
But we do not tell anybody because she would get locked up and not be allowed to go while the sisters who are not the most conventionally attractive girls go to the ball.
Cinderella gets to go when the fairy godmother makes her pumpkin into a carriage.
So she goes to the ball.
Of course the prince pays attention to her because she is got this glow about her because not everything is of this earth.
He decides that this is the one he chooses.
But cinderella remembers she hasta be home before midnight because she is going to return to the scullery maid.
The pumpkin's going to lose its wheels.
The horses will be end up being mice again.
So that is what happens.
She barely makes it home in time to serve breakfast the next morning when the town crier goes from house to house to try to find who matches the glass slipper that got left behind.
Now why that glass slipper did not turn into something else at midnight is beyond me because i have always thought that was a flaw in the story.
But i did not ever point it out in public because i would get into trouble.
So here is this glass slipper that did not turn into back into whatever it useta be.
The first sister tries it.
It does not work.
The second sister tries it and lucky it did not break.
"Then just as the town crier's leaving, cinderella wants to try it."
Of course it matches the same size of her foot.
Then the town crier declares that he is found the princess.
"The moment the shoe goes on, somehow the clothes come back."
So she gets to ride off with her fairy fairy prince.
Nobody ever tells you that twenty years later they got a divorce.
How i would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I would skip the bread.
I would get the peanut butter.
First i would put peanut butter on a spoon.
Then i would put jelly on the spoon.
I would eat it out of the spoon but not the bread.
Well i would cut the crusts off first.
Then i would spread the jelly on one side.
I would spread the peanut butter on the other side.
Then i would put it together and cut it in two.
Corner to corner and make triangles and put it on a plate and give it to them.
Okay so the most joyful moment of my life was the night after my first child was born.
My motherinlaw flew from delaware to boston not really at my beck and call.
But my then husband asked her to come.
She wanted to be in the delivery room with me.
I did not want her to be there.
At one point she was massaging my feet.
Most likely neither of you have had children yet.
But you do not necessarily want someone touching you when you are in the throes of labor.
So anyway i essentially kicked her out of the room.
She is off in some visiting room you know.
She has not had any dinner.
Everybody's gone.
I think it is probably two in the morning.
So i rang the nurse.
I did not have the baby with me because back then.
I mean you had to request to have the baby in the room with you.
Otherwise they would just keep them in the baby area so that the mother could sleep.
They and they would bring the baby to you when it was time to feed.
But they really wanted the mothers to sleep.
I understand that because once you are home forget it.
But you know i had not really gotten a chance to see her.
So i rang the nurses.
I said.
Could you please bring my baby?
They said.
Well we have not bathed her yet.
I said.
I do not care.
I want to see my baby.
So they brought her in.
They left the door open ajar.
So there was just just enough light coming in the room.
I am holding this perfect beautiful baby.
It was just like this joy welled up.
She she did not wake up.
She just laid there.
But it was like this tableau this glowing moment of just perfection.
Oh i tell ya!
I did it two more times!
So you know it hadta be worth it the first time.
Once upon a time there is a little boy outside kicking his soccer ball.
He kicked it so hard he made a goal in through his neighbor's window.
His neighbor stood up and looked out the window and could see no source of the ball.
Bobby had just turned ten.
He liked making up his own mind.
His mother would not let him make up his own mind about a lot of things.
His mother said.
Bobby do not forget your umbrella.
It is going to rain.
Bobby said.
I do not need my umbrella.
If it rains i do not care.
I will get wet.
She said.
So out bobby went.
Sure enough halfway down the block it started to rain.
He said.
I am going to get soaking wet!
So he turned around and ran back home did not want to have to say to his mom that he was wrong.
His mom knew that it would have hurt his pride.
So she just gave him the umbrella and quietly scooted him back out the door.
Janey wanted him to come inside and play a board game with her.
So she opened the door to go and try to get his attention.
The cat got out.
The cat was an indoor cat not allowed outside.
Janey got so scared because she knew her daddy would be mad.
So she ran back inside and closed the door.
Then she realized that the cat was still outside.
So back out she went.
Now the dog followed her.
The dog chased the cat up a tree.
Janey ran over and got her daddy's attention finally.
You could hear the dog barking.
You could see the cat up in the tree.
So he turned off the lawnmower.
He went into the garage.
He got their ladder.
He climbed up onto the tree limb.
Well what he did not realize was that he could not reach the cat from where he was without breaking the tree limb.
The little girl janey in the meantime was trying to convince her kitty to come down into her arms.
But he was not going to budge.
So there her mom was watching this all from the kitchen window.
So she called the fire department.
Over they came to rescue her husband from the tree.
Eventually the cat decided to come down the right way.
He scratched at the back door when he was done with his adventure.
Yes i have.
Does it have to be the book's story or can it be whatever cinderella story i want to tell?
But i am not going to do your disney version.
So once upon a time hunter who lived in the forest with his wife and his beautiful daughter ella.
Sadly ella's mother died.
Being a very busy huntsman he realized he needed to remarry.
So he married a woman from the town who he really did not know.
So they got married.
Let us see.
But so they got married.
I am making this up now.
Unbeknownst to him she had been married before.
She had two daughters of her own.
So all of a sudden he went from having to support three people to five.
Well he did his best.
They lived fairly well.
As the girls grew up ella's stepsisters began to treat her unfairly.
They realized that their stepfather loved her far more than they loved them.
They did not understand why.
So they would tease her.
Her stepmother would ask all of the girls to do chores around the house.
But eventually it just became cinder ella's responsibility to clean.
She would get cinders ashes all over her.
So they gave her the nickname cinderella.
The local prince is has decided to have a ball.
His mother wants him to get married.
So and so he invites all of the eligible women from the land to come to the ball.
So the two sisters of course get very excited.
Their mother helps them choose their dresses.
But they figure cinderella does not want to go.
She you know she is not very sophisticated.
So they just do not bother with her.
So cinderella's very sad that she cannot go to the ball.
So she is just sitting in the corner over by the hearth.
They have all left.
All of the lights flash.
This little old lady is suddenly standing there in front of her.
She says that she is her fairy godmother and that she is there to grant cinderella's wishes.
So cinderella says.
Oh i wish i could go to the ball.
So her fairy godmother taps her with her wand.
She taps her feet.
She has these beautiful glass slippers.
And she taps the pumpkin.
It turns into this coach.
She taps the mice.
They turn into the coachmen.
She taps the rat.
He becomes the horse.
So she arrives at the ball.
The prince only has eyes for her.
They wind up dancing all night.
But one of the things that the fairy godmother said was.
At midnight the spell wears off.
That must be where my parents got it their idea of what a good curfew was.
So the clock starts to gong for midnight.
Cinderella realizes oh my gosh she is she is got to get outta there.
So she runs away.
The prince is chasing after her.
As she is running down the stairs she loses one of her glass slippers.
She hasta take the other one off and hold it and run.
She manages to get home in the carriage before everything turns back the way it was.
So the next day her sisters are complaining that the prince only had eyes for this one woman that nobody recognized.
Cinderella's sort of smiling to herself because she knows.
She has this lovely secret.
Even though she may never be able to do it again at least she can take this this idea that she danced with the prince.
She would take that with her to her grave.
He wants to find this beautiful woman.
He has this glass slipper.
So he starts going around the countryside trying the glass slipper on all of the available women.
It does not fit anybody.
Even women whose foot should fit it they they just would not fit.
So finally he comes to cinderella's house.
The stepsisters run out.
They want to try on the the shoe.
It does not fit either of them.
So the prince says.
They say.
Oh yeah just our sister ella but you know she was not at the ball.
He said.
So he slips the slipper on her foot.
It fits perfectly.
Then she takes the other one out of her pocket.
She puts it on the other.
The fairy godmother arrives.
Suddenly cinderella is dressed beautifully again in her gown.
She and the prince look at each other.
They kiss.
Off they go to the palace where they get married.
She let us them live in the palace but just away from wherever she is.
There is the disney cinderella.
It i do not know if it is a grimm's fairy tale or if it is a.
So and things were starting to be politically incorrect as i was growing up to want to be cinderella to want to have barbie dolls and all that.
So she goes to parties you know where they want the little mermaid or whatever.
She dresses up.
She sings.
She can sing exactly like all of the 's awesome disney princesses.
I would buy really great bread like multigrain or organic fresh out of the oven bread.
I would slice it.
Then i would get not the good for me peanut butter but the peanut butter that has the sugar in it and the salt smooth.
I would i would just cover the slice of bread so you really cannot see the edges.
I like the seeds.
"Same thing , spread."
Then i would cut it on the diagonal bebecause i always like triangles instead of rectangles.
So when i was just coming out of college i was really kind of in a crazy place.
I wanted to get into traveling.
I had this feeling that i was going to be called towards you know doing meditation more.
I have done yoga from a really young age.
But i had a really really crazy time in college.
I kind of knew that that chapter was closing.
Something new was opening.
But i did not know where to begin.
I swear by this.
The book fell off the shelf.
I did not touch this book.
This book fell off the shelf.
It was called spirit junkie by this woman named gabrielle bernstein.
I opened up that book.
My whole life changed after that.
She broke down the gift of healing of going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that i had never heard of.
I went to a catholic school.
She just opened up this door that you can heal through this this way of prayer and of asking for help.
So i started doing her writing exercises.
I started doing her meditations.
I just threw myself into this lifestyle.
I started praying every night.
I started praying every morning.
I started noticing that my life was getting lighter.
That i was attracting things in my life that i could not have before because i was blocking myself.
She was showing me those blocks.
She had no exception.
Oh you do not really meditate?
You have time for this.
That book led me to daily prayer to meditations to traveling far beyond what i ever thought that i was brave enough to do.
That led me to india where i became a yoga teacher.
It is led me to meet gabrielle bernstein on several occasions.
I listen to her podcasts regularly.
I share her message.
I swear i have been on this earth for twenty four years.
But i did not start living until two years ago when i found that book on that shelf.
Now i think about my job and how i can give back to other people.
How i can keep traveling.
How i can care for my family.
How i can care for the people that i love.
This place of peace and mediation which i think completely changed my life.
I see it even in the negative ways.
Through meditation able to not feel attacked by the world you know.
If i get a person that comes in.
I work at a restaurant you know?
I live a really ordinary life.
If i have somebody come into the restaurant and give me an attitude.
Then i get into the like.
You know what i mean?
Then i get into the attitude.
Then i step back and because i have that meditation practice and that awareness i can say.
I am getting sucked into their energy.
I am getting sucked into their story.
What do i want to be attracting?
What to i want to be feeling?
Then i am grateful that it happened.
I am so happy that i had somebody come in and be like.
You are getting lazy.
You know sharpen sharpen your senses here.
Then i go back with a whole new attitude.
They change.
They bring that energy to me.
If in the case where they do not and they are stuck in that place i can be like.
Hey that is their thing going on.
I got to protect my energy.
It is just a different way of looking at life.
Yeah you get hooked on it.
Yeah it feels good to feel good.
But it just feels good to feel good.
It is overflowing.
You are not an empty cup filling it for other people.
Yeah thinking that that i loved your octopus earrings.
I am glad that you said that so i had the opportunity to share that with you.
That is how it starts.
So little johnny was running around outside playing with his soccer ball when he kicked as hard as he absolutely could and aimed it right at the window on accident.
Where did this come from?
Now we will have to fix it.
He looked out the window.
He saw johnny looking through with wide scared eyes.
His dad went outside and asked johnny what happened.
Johnny explained that it was accident.
His dad forgave him right away.
He explained that it is really hard sometimes to make this money to pay for these windows.
But we understand it was an accident.
A little boy was getting ready to go to school when his mom warned that the rain was coming.
She said.
No no i do not want the umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
He started walking to school.
The rain began to pour.
The clothes he was wearing became soaked.
He started running back to the house angry and frustrated that everything that he was wearing even down to his socks were soaking wet from the rain.
When he got home he yelled at his mom.
It is raining outside.
I am soaking wet!
I told you the rain was coming.
Why did not you trust me?
She said.
I thought that i would be fine on my own.
She said.
Remember next time i say it is going to rain it is okay to listen to me.
Then he went to school.
The little girl was searching everywhere for her cat.
She looked around the house.
She looked in the backyard.
She went down to the school.
"As she was walking back through the park, she saw her little cat up on the edge of a tree."
How am i going to get him down?
She cried.
So she asked a neighbor if he would come and help her and climb up the tree.
"As the man climbed up the tree through a ladder, the ladder accidently knocked over."
The cat became nervous.
"Although she was used to climbing trees because she was an outdoor cat, she began to get nervous by the man inching closer and closer to her on the branch."
She stayed there stubbornly until the man decided to call the fire department.
He pulled the phone out of his pocket and called to explain the situation.
As he got more stressed out and the girl was crying and the sirens were going from the fire truck and the dog began to bark the cat became more and more stressed out.
When the firemen got there they set the ladder back up so that the man could crawl back down from the tree.
They set up the ladder climbed up slowly quietly coaxing the cat over to them with treats and soft words.
The cat slowly inched closer to them from the branch as they scooped him up and came back down the ladder.
The little girl was so excited when the cat was returned to her.
My mom has told me this every night when i was a kid.
Okay i will give myself a refresher.
So there once was a little girl named cinderella whose mother passed away at a really young age.
So she is left in the care of her father.
While her father was caring for cinderella he was concerned about having a wife for himself when he met cinderella's soontobe stepmother.
Cinderella's father married the woman and her two daughters.
Shortly after they were married and the family was one the father passed away.
After he passed away cinderella got to know her family in a different way.
This lack of compassion this lack of caring led her daughters to be even worse.
Because they got no attention no love and no care from their mother they took out a lot of their anger on cinderella bullying her pushing her around and making her do all the housework.
Her work made her humble and independent.
Cinderella doted on the stepsisters hand and foot.
One particular day when they were extremely agitated irritated and picking on cinderella there was a knock at the door.
They were told that there was going to be a ball this evening.
All of the maidens of the land were invited.
So the two stepsisters got so excited.
They slammed the door shut.
They ran up to their rooms.
They began getting ready.
Cinderella became so excited.
A chance to leave the house chance to meet new people chance to start over and start fresh to be seen.
So she began getting ready when she was immediately disrupted by her sisters demanding her help with helping them get ready getting their dresses together cooking and cleaning and taking out all of anger out on cinderella.
So she worked tirelessly all day helping the sisters taking care of the sisters taking care of the mother.
Finally right before the ball cinderella stole away.
She ran up to her room.
With the help of her friends and the creatures that lived along side of her and had compassion for cinderella's story she made a beautiful dress.
She did her hair up beautifully.
With the resources that she had she looked absolutely stunning.
She went downstairs to meet her sisters and join them for the ball.
They gasped at what they saw.
She looked stunning.
That made them even angrier.
They became so jealous and outraged at the thought that cinderella thought that she should be more than just a servant.
They ripped her clothes and her jewelry bullied her and told her that she was absolutely unable to come.
Cinderella retreated to her room crying defeated disappointed.
The sister's went off to the ball.
Cinderella began to cry.
Just when she thought she had completely given up when she was ready to accept herself as just a maid and nothing more in this life she saw a white light appear.
That white light began to grow and grow and grow until it took the shape of a beautiful pleasant grandmother looking woman.
She helped cinderella up to her feet wiped the tears from her face and asked her.
Do you want to go to the ball?
Do you want to go to the ball this evening?
Cinderella said.
I want that more than anything.
But i cannot do it.
I have no support.
I have no way of getting there.
The godmother immediately took to work.
She began by lighting up the room with her magic.
The birds were dancing.
Everything was coming back into order.
She quickly swirled her wand around cinderella.
A gorgeous white gown appeared.
Cinderella had never looked so beautiful before.
How will i get to the ball?
She asked.
As they went outside they saw a huge fat pumpkin sitting there and a bunch of rats skittering around.
Cinderella looked at it doubtfully.
But after seeing what a beautiful dress she had created she was open to anything.
The fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a beautiful white horse drawn carriage.
You have to get off to the ball.
She said.
But you have to be back by midnight.
If you do not come back by midnight all the magic will disappear.
Remembering this warning cinderella jumped into the carriage.
When she arrived she was unsure what to expect.
She had never left the the castle before.
Her dark and deary life had never been opened up in this way before.
When she walked inside and saw the beautiful dresses and the shiny earrings and the beautiful chandeliers she was immediately taken back by its beauty.
As she was going towards the ballroom dance floor the prince himself was so humbled by her grace and by her beauty by her innocence and by her wonder.
He immediately asked her to dance.
They saw the joy and the authenticity in each other and danced the night away.
Right before midnight cinderella heard the clock strike.
She knew it was time for her to go.
She had been so lost in this happiness in this dream that she completely lost track of time.
She ran out of the palace as fast as she could leaving a slipper behind on the step.
Against his pleas for her to stay to know her name she ran off knowing where destiny was going to be.
She hopped in the carriage and headed off home as it stumbled and turned back into a pumpkin.
The beautiful galliant horses became little fuzzy rats.
She got back to her house just in time to safely go back up to her room in her rags with a pumpkin being a pumpkin and rats being rats.
But she had a new sense of mind a new sense of wonder.
With a little bit of magic and with a little bit of hope she knew that she could be more than what she thought she was before.
She went the next couple days being totally at peace.
As the sisters demanded things it did not phase her.
As they asked for things she obliged and stayed in the calm confinements of her mind.
Then one day there was a knock on the door.
There was an official from the castle.
They announced that they were going around to every house and having every maiden try on the slipper until they could find what was the maiden that the prince had been looking for from the night at the ball.
As he entered the sisters pushed and pulled and fought their way to the front so that they could be the first to try the shoe on demanding that they have the prince's full attention.
They tried to fit their feet into the slippers.
Flinging it around between the two of them the man decided that they were certainly not the woman.
Cinderella peered around the corner.
One of the attendants noticed her.
Is this another young woman that lives in the house?
They tried to block her and cover her from sight.
We insist that we have to try every single woman that lives in this land.
Cinderella stepped forward.
As she gracefully sat down and placed her foot out he slid the slipper on.
They knew right away that she was the one.
Cinderella left without looking back into her new life where she became the princess of the land with a man that truly loved and respected her.
First i would take the wheat bread.
Then i would spread all natural chunky peanut butter bebecause that is my favorite.
Then i would do just a little bit of jam.
If i was feeling really crazy i might even put it on top of the stove and grill it a little bit.
Ooh oh so i think it was two or three years ago.
I my so i have two cats.
Well i did have two cats.
I feel bad saying this.
But i favored one of them because kind of crabby and not nice.
She had always had respiratory problems.
We took her to the vet when she was a kitten.
They think she was probably the runt of her litter.
She it did not affect anything about her.
You could just always hear her breathing.
She would sneeze all the time.
But so about two or three years ago she started not eating.
Then obviously she got really skinny because she was not eating.
So we took her to the vet.
They hadta give her this special wet food that was really strong smelling because they thought that her respiratory problems were preventing her from smelling her food.
When cats cannot smell their food they do not eat it.
So we hadta give her this special food that we hadta microwave.
We also have a dog.
So the cats stay upstairs.
The dog stays downstairs.
We named her when we were really little.
We said her fur looks like peanut butter.
But we just called her peanut which is the most little kid thing to do.
Her fur looks like peanut butter.
So we are going to call her peanut butter.
She had white and black all over her.
She when she got really skinny we hadta give her her special microwaved food.
She would not care about the dog anymore and would just come right down into the kitchen.
The dog would be looking at her like.
What are you doing?
She just will look at him like this.
When the dog went over to sniff her she would just hiss at him and was not even angry hissing.
I thought she was doing okay.
She got to a point where she was skinnier than she useta be.
But it it stayed at one point.
I think we had taken her to the vet a few times already in the two months leading up to this.
I think it was a saturday.
My mom called us down to the kitchen.
Usually when she calls down to the kitchen and does not tell us she probably wants us to do chores.
So i took my time.
So i came downstairs.
Everyone was sitting at the table.
This does not really seem like it is about chores.
My mom said.
I do not know if any of you guys heard me when i left this morning because i did leave pretty early.
So you guys were i think all sleeping.
She said that she had taken peanut to the vet.
She did not come back with her.
So and i think it really affected me because i had no say in it.
I did not know it was going to happen at all.
Well i think the most important way that it affected me is my other cat is still alive.
I do not let my mom go to the vet alone.
I will always go with her.
We have a bunny now.
I always go with her with the bunny and with the cats.
So that really affected me with.
So and i loved her so much.
So it was definitely a big thing to do with trust.
Okay so in the beginning a little boy is playing with a soccer ball.
In the middle the he kicks the soccer ball.
It goes flying through a guy's window.
In the end the man whose window just got broken is looking outside to see who kicked a soccer ball through his window.
Okay so in the beginning it looks like a mom is trying to give her son an umbrella telling him to take the umbrella.
He says.
I do not need it.
Then when he goes outside it starts raining of course.
He runs back to the house.
Okay mom i guess you were right.
Then in the end he brings his umbrella.
Okay so it looks like a cat got stuck in a tree in the beginning.
So she goes out and looks for her cat.
It looks like her dad went with her and brought a ladder to get the cat out of the tree.
Then when he got up into the tree his ladder fell.
I think either his dog or someone else's dog saw a bird the man and the cat in the tree and was like.
So he went to the tree and is barking at them because there is a cat and a man and a bird in the tree.
Then someone called the the police and was like.
We need help getting a man and a cat out of a tree.
So they treat her kind of like a maid.
They do not treat her like family.
She does all the cooking and cleaning.
Then they the kingdom that they live in is having a ball.
Cinderella makes her own dress with help from her mice and her birds.
But when her stepmother and her stepsisters see her in the dress they are afraid that the prince is going to think that cinderella is way prettier than them bebecause she is.
They they ruin her dress.
They rip it.
So she cannot wear it.
Then they leave for the ball.
Cinderella is crying outside.
Her fairy godmother appears and makes her a beautiful dress glass slippers a carriage out of a pumpkin and her horse to pull the carriage.
She says that.
You will have all of this stuff until midnight.
"But when it is midnight, it is all going to go away."
So cinderella goes to the ball.
The the prince thinks she is the most beautiful girl that he is ever seen.
They dance.
He falls in love with her.
But he before she tells him her name she it is about to be midnight.
So she hasta go back before he sees who she really is.
When she is running away she leaves her glass slipper by accident.
So when the prince is trying to find her he is like.
Okay well we can find out who she is by going around and the whole kingdom and seeing whose foot fits into the glass slipper.
So they one of the prince's guard guys goes around.
But obviously is was not and bebecause the glass slipper does not fit on either of their feet.
Then they find cinderella.
She tries it on.
They find out that she was the one.
Her and the prince get married.
First of all i would not bebecause i hate peanut butter and jelly.
"But if i had to, i would get definitely whole grain bread."
Peanut butter on one side jam on the other side and then put it together.
If i am feeling like a child i would cut off the crusts.
So something important that happened to me was i went to visit one of my good friends when she was studying abroad.
I visited her the week that she was leaving.
So i went to visit her.
Bebecause we happened to meet in poland a few years prior.
Then i went to go visit her when she was there abroad.
She had made a lot of friends.
I guess international friends through just her semester being there.
I just got to hang out with them while i was there for the week and got to know them.
There was one night we had a party and went.
That was so important to me getting a diverse perspective on everything and meet a lot of people.
It really opened my eyes that here in new hampshire we do not have a lot of diversity.
But it was just interesting to see how everybody grew up.
It was very very different than how i grew up.
We were all talking about the spongebob episode of the krusty krab pizza.
There was a girl from russia.
There was a guy from turkey.
There were literally people from everywhere.
Oh my god the krusty krab pizza episode with the rock.
Yeah we really went off on that one.
It was interesting to see just like these people that grew up thousands of miles away from me.
Watch the same thing and we talked all about the same things.
We all had the same fears and hopes.
So this boy here is practicing his soccer moves.
I think my brothers did this one time actually.
So in his practicing he kicks the ball through the window.
It shatters.
It just so happens to land on the lap.
Oh no it hits the lamp.
It hits the lamp of 's house.
His dad looks out the window to see what is up with the soccer ball in his hand.
Because that guy messed up.
So it looks like this is a mother and son.
The mom is telling the kid to take his umbrella.
It is going to rain or it is raining.
Then he leaves his mom with the umbrella.
Then he goes outside.
It is raining.
It is pouring rain.
He is getting wet.
He realizes it is a bad idea.
He is turning to go back into his house.
So he comes in soaking wet.
Yeah i told you so.
So this girl was riding her bike outside.
Then this dog came along and scared the cat into going up the tree.
He tried to go get the cat from the tree.
But then maybe the dog knocked over the ladder because the dog's trying to get up the tree to get he cat.
So the fire department hadta come to come take this man down from the tree.
Yes i have.
Once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella or ella.
Then i think they added the cinder because she was dirty or something.
Because she had to clean.
Anyway so there was this girl.
She had a family.
Then her mother ended up dying.
I do not know.
I remember they had longer kind of mouthful names.
So they ended up moving in.
The two sisters bicker a lot.
The the stepmom did not like cinderella.
Then i think the father ended up dying.
So now cinderella was left with the evil stepmother and the two evil stepsisters.
You are just going to be a maid in the house.
Because she did not really like her.
So she exiled her to a room in the attic and made her pretty much a servant.
"One day the prince , prince charming , you know announced that he was having a ball."
I think in order to look for a wife or something like that.
The stepmother really wanted the stepsisters to go.
The stepsisters wanted to go too because they wanted to go meet the prince and have their shot at him and see if they can marry him.
Oh cool maybe i will go.
So i think cinderella has her animal accomplices.
I know one's the mice named gus gus.
I do not remember the other one.
They make a dress for her.
I think it was her mom's stuff.
So she gets an old dress of her mom's.
Then they make it all pretty and stuff for her.
So she is getting ready to go to the ball.
She walks downstairs to go out.
The sisters and the stepmother rip her dress apart and rip off her jewelry because they do not want her going.
I think maybe they locked her in a room or something.
I do not know how she ends up getting out.
But anyways she ends up going to the ball or sneaking out to the ball or getting ready to go.
Then fairy godmother appears.
Okay she does not try to sneak out.
The fairy godmother appears first and then is like.
Ooh let us turn you into a beautiful princess.
Then she turns her gown into this beautiful ball gown.
I do not know how she got there.
The pumpkin that she is sitting on turns into a carriage.
Her animal friends turn into horses.
So then she goes to the ball.
She makes this late grand entrance.
So they have a dance.
But one of the conditions of this magic from the fairy godmother was that it expires at midnight.
So she is dancing with him.
The clock strikes to symbolize that or midnight is coming.
Oh my god i got to go.
So she leaves the prince in a hurry and is running down the stairs.
She leaves her glass slipper which she had on and then runs away into the woods and turns back into her dress disappears and her pumpkin and everything.
So then the prince goes on a hunt with his servant or whoever to find the girl he danced with at the ball because she was unrecognizable because she just looked so good.
I do not know how.
The stepmother and the stepsisters i think found out that it was cinderella who had danced with the prince.
They were getting really upset because they are like.
Oh my god this guy's going to come and figure it out.
Then the stepdaughters will not get a chance to be the prince's wife or whatever.
So the prince finally comes to the house after making his rounds.
The two stepsisters try on the shoes.
They do not fit.
I do not know if they try them on or not.
Anyway the stepmother ends up breaking the glass shoe.
Cinderella who was locked in her room by the stepmother because she knew the prince was coming comes downstairs after the shoe is broken.
I have the other glass slipper.
She brings it down.
Then the prince finds out it was her that he danced with.
Then they get married.
They live happily ever after.
If i were making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for somebody else because i do not like peanut butter and jelly i would get out my bread.
Then i would get a knife or a spreader.
Then i would take the jelly.
Then i would put it on the other side of the bread.
Then i would put them together.
I am not a very athletic person which some people would disagree with because played soccer for my whole life leading up to that part.
But when i was not playing soccer i would be reading or writing or playing video games or on the computer in my room.
If i did want to do something i would want to do it by myself outside.
So i stopped playing soccer because i stopped enjoying it.
I joined the swim team because i was like.
I need to do something that will help my body not be as lazy as i wanted to be.
I need to do something active that will help my body.
I heard that swimming was really good for you.
Ever since i was a kid i loved going to a lake or to a beach and swimming.
It was my favorite thing to do.
I will join swim team and maybe competitive swimming will be nice.
I do not think i am ever going to do this again.
Then sophomore year came.
I signed up again because i was like.
I need to do it.
I would i got through freshman year.
I only vomited one time the first day i was there.
Well my dad had made a huge dinner for me.
He forgot that i had practice.
So i ate the whole dinner.
I went to practice.
So i was going as hard as i can.
I did not know any of the strokes right.
So i was just flailing in the water until i vomited.
But i made the team.
Sophomore year we had this thing called.
All of the swim teams competed in a big competition just to say.
One of the issues i have always had with swim team is that i would love going to the practice and talking with the people on the teams but whenever we would compete was when i would get super nervous.
There were times where someone had asked me like.
I need you to do this race for me.
Or like i cannot do this race.
They would ask me to step in.
The idea of going into a situation and saying.
Okay i only have to do these few races.
Was something that kept me calm during those.
So when someone would come up and say like.
Hey i need you to do this race.
Or i need you to do this.
It would throw off my balance.
I cannot even swim anymore or something like that.
But there were sometimes it worked out and sometimes it did not.
I still wanted to help the team.
So 's nice when this regional race came up it was the first time i had gone to it because i had missed it my freshman year bebecause i had to go to some family thing.
What had happened last year was we got last place out of everyone.
But this year our coach was telling us that he had high hopes for us because we had won a majority of our our other meets.
So he put everyone on their usual races.
Then for me and some other kids he gave us some extra races which was something i would never dealt with before.
I would usually been put down to do two races or maybe occasionally three.
But i think i had four for this event.
But i got up there.
I raced as best as i could.
I swam as best as i could.
I feel like i am messing up.
But every once in a while i see i am ahead of one other team.
I keep going.
I i stayed consistent with would been swimming throughout the year.
Then when it came to it at the end of the day which it seven hour meet or something.
At the end of the day we got points back.
We had actually gotten seventh place out of eighth.
We were ecstatic because we had not lost again 's awescome for the second year in a row.
Yeah an important moment i guess.
After that we would done a lot better.
I think my senior year we actually got fourth place or something which was good.
Then i think our girls' team actually got first which was awesome.
We had some really great swimmers on the girls' team.
The guys' team was made up of people who did not want to play soccer anymore.
When he kicks the ball it accidentally hits the window of a house.
It breaks into the house and knocks over a lamp in the house.
There is a gentleman in the house who is very concerned who picks up the ball and then looks outside of the window.
I assume looking for the boy who kicked it or for who kicked it.
A mother is telling her son not to take an umbrella with him while he is heading to school.
The son is saying that he does not need it.
The mother is slightly concerned but kind of is just surprised that he is actually heading out.
He says goodbye without taking the umbrella.
He heads outside and is distraught to see that it is raining.
He quickly runs back in when the rain starts to pick up.
When he gets inside he is soaked and his mother is looking disappointed.
But then he returns back outside kind of looking sad or unnerved now carrying the umbrella.
A young girl who has been playing outside with her dog.
So she tells her father to help her get the cat out of the tree.
He brings a ladder outside and sets it up against the tree and climbs onto the tree.
But it falls over.
He gets stuck as well.
So they end up having to call the fire department who show up in a firetruck.
Two firemen bring a ladder over to help them.
I think i do.
Then the father mysteriously disappears for some reason.
Probably killed or murdered or maimed for his money assuming that the evil stepmother is true to name.
Then when she grows up she is kind of taken on as a maid for the evil stepmother and evil stepsisters.
They all tell her to clean the floor and wash the dishes and make their food and stuff like that.
Eventually one day the king of this kingdom that she lives in decides he is going to host a grand ball to find a wife or a partner for his son the prince.
The evil stepmother gets invited to the ball.
She decides that it would be a great idea to have her two actual daughters go.
She schemes to have cinderella stay behind.
Cinderella does not know this.
So she is mystified.
She makes a dress.
She gets prepared.
Then when she shows up to go to the ball the evil stepmother tears off her necklace and shreds up her clothing and says that she is not allowed to go because she is simple and she is not one of the family.
So the evil stepmother goes with the evil stepsisters to the ball.
That is when her fairy godmother shows up and transforms some of her animal friends into humans and transforms a pumpkin into a giant chariot and gives her a magic dress and glass slippers and provides her with everything she needs for this party.
She heads out to the party in her pumpkin mobile.
They dance together.
The the evil stepmother and stepsisters see that they are dancing and are shocked.
I do not know if they recognize her.
But they are shocked to see that they are not the ones who are getting to dance with the prince.
But cinderella hasta leave because her magic wears off at midnight which is stupid.
That does not make sense to me.
If it is magic it should just work.
But she leaves.
But she left behind a glass slipper which the prince finds.
The prince is mystified by her and decides he has to go and find out who she is.
So he roams the land fitting a shoe onto fair maidens trying to figure out if they are the one that he danced with because apparently he just cannot remember her face.
I guess he just can only remember her shoe size?
But eventually he arrives at cinderella's house where the evil stepmother has locked her in a building.
I do not know if it was in the book.
Then the animals help her get out of the room.
She shows up downstairs when the prince is fitting the shoe onto the stepsisters' feet.
Then he sees her and kind of instantly knows it is her but then has to put the shoe on because once again i guess he just cannot remember her face.
Then shoe fits.
They fall in love.
She can go off and do her own thing i guess.
There is really no resolution on their side.
It is just cinderella gets to live happily ever after which is good enough.
So you would retrieve your bread from wherever you are keeping bread.
You would open the bread.
Then you would find a plate.
You would put out the plate.
Then you would find a knife.
Once you have your knife you would go to the fridge and take out the jelly.
Then you would take out the peanut butter.
Some people put it in the fridge but i do not.
So i just take it out from a drawer or from a cabinet.
Then you put the jelly on one side of the bread using the knife to scoop it out and slab slab slather it?
I think that is a word.
Then you take the peanut butter and do the same thing on the other side.
Make sure the bread's closed as well.
Then you fold the sandwich together.
There you go.
Let us see.
Recently my daughter has been doing algebra.
She kind of got bumped up a grade in math.
So i am the math help that she goes towards.
So doing a lot i was helping her out quite a bit when she was first starting.
Now i am starting to realize that she does not ask me as much for help.
In fact she often challenges me a little bit on what she is doing.
She talked about some kind of form of an equation.
I had no idea what she was talking about.
So you know recent and and kind of like a proud moment of and also a little bit unnerving that she is passing me since i have a career kind of in mathematics.
Yeah i think so.
"Tommy was goofing off and playing with his soccer ball, kicking it high as he could in the air, when it went once off the side of his foot and through mister wilson's window."
"Mister wilson, who happened to be sitting in a chair right next to the window, had the ball and the glass hit him."
He looked out the window.
But he saw noone bebecause the kid had run away.
Kyle's mom told him that it was about to rain.
He needed to bring his umbrella to school.
I am not bringing umbrella to school.
He took ten minutes outside of his house as he was walking to school.
It started raining.
"So he sprinted back home, completely drenched, and got his umbrella which was pointless because he was already drenched."
Tom was going for a walk.
He was next to his neighbor's house when his neighbor's dog chased him up a tree bebecause he was deathly terrified of dogs.
"At the same time, their neighbor's kid's cat also climbed up in the tree."
She was all freaked out about that.
The dog is barking.
Someone called the fire department.
I cannot remember his name.
He never lived it down.
No i think i can remember.
Cinderella was living with her stepmom and her stepsisters who were pains in the neck towards her.
"There was a big event, a ball that was going on in town."
Cinderella really wanted to go.
But because her stepmom and stepsisters always bugged her she she had to stay home and clean.
So she made a wish that she would be able to go to the ball.
"Her fairy godmother showed up and and with a little hocuspocus magic gave cinderella a beautiful dress, a carriage, some dudes to drive the carriage."
So she went ball.
She met the prince.
One of the rules that she had to follow was that all this is going to disappear at midnight.
But so she kind of lost track of time.
She was dancing with the prince.
Midnight struck.
She took off.
She dropped her slipper.
She took off.
She made it home.
Everything changed.
Nobody really knew who who was at the ball.
The prince was enamored with who he was dancing with.
He he he put out a call to find out who it was.
So he set up this thing where everybody could try on the one slipper.
So he was trying to find this person that he was dancing with.
Everybody was trying it on.
It did not fit.
The stepsisters were trying to jam their big dumb feet into it.
They could not do it.
Cinderella kind of meekly said.
Can i try?
She did.
It fit.
They got married.
They lived happily ever after.
I have not.
I was enamored with this cartoon called speed buggy.
I mean i i guarantee you have never heard of it.
But it was sort of in the the style of scooby doo where there was a group of kids that solved crimes.
I even think shaggy's brother from scooby doo was the dune buggy driver.
The dune buggy talked.
They kind of solved crimes.
Every once in a while i will just go to craigslist and look for dune buggys for sale.
It is a certain style of dune buggy where it is kind of the big fendery flowing body of the car and the single roll bar behind the backseat.
I will just sit there for half an hour and just look for dune buggys for sale in america and dream.
I will never say no.
I would get out the loaf of bread.
I would get out a jar of peanut butter.
I would get out a jar of jelly as well as two butter knives.
I would take two slices of bread out of the bag of the loaf of bread and set them on a plate side by side.
I would open up the jar of peanut butter pick up the butter knife and scoop out a big dollop of the peanut butter and spread that on one one slice of the bread.
I would then grab the other butter knife and the jar of jelly.
Then i would pick up both of those pieces of bread from underneath and slap ththem together.
Then i would cut the sandwich from corner to corner diagonally.
So please talk as much as you can about each one bebecause we are really interested in learning about your language.
I guess i will just talk about my experience moving up here kind of getting a job up here.
So i went to school in florida.
There is a big company that owns all of florida utilities.
I had been trying to work for this company for a really long time.
Ever since i was a freshmen i had been kind of sending my resume on to them even though they did not want freshmen.
I have like twenty five rejections from this company in my email.
I got a reply back.
But the the position was not in florida where i was based.
So my summer before i graduated i drove up to new hampshire by myself and kind of got a hotel in the middle of nowhere by myself and interned at this nuclear plant.
I ended up really liking it and having a lot of fun with the coworkers.
So i went back down.
They gave me a job offer.
So then about six months later i kind of i i got an apartment without having looked at it.
I called my apartment complex and was just like.
Sure i will take this one bedroom that you have without looking at it.
Then two days before i left i was like.
I am going to adopt a cat and drive it up to new hampshire with me.
So i adopted a cat and put it in the car with me and did another road trip back up from florida to new hampshire by myself not knowing anyone in the state.
So i moved up here.
Then through my job and playing volleyball i made a good group of friends.
I am moving in with my boyfriend now who i met up here.
It is going to be a lot of change 's awesome.
I split it up into two and a half days.
I think if you drove straight it would be a little over twenty hours.
Actually he is leaving.
He went to northeastern.
Then i have a lot of family in new york and on long island.
So there was a little boy who had a dad who was always busy with work.
He never really spent too much time with him.
He was playing soccer.
He kicked the ball.
It it broke through the window.
His it knocked over his dad's lamp.
He thought his dad was going to be super mad.
At first his dad was really mad and then kind of grabbed the ball and looked up and realized that his son had been outside playing by himself and that he should probably go outside and play with him too.
So there was a little boy who got ready because it was picture day at school.
His mom said.
Hey you should take this umbrella because it is going to rain.
We do not want to mess up your nice picture day clothes.
The boy said.
No no i do not need that umbrella.
As soon as he starts walking to school it starts pouring rain.
He he runs back into the house.
I told you this was going to happen.
He said.
Then he grabbed an umbrella and started making his way back towards school even though he was wet for picture day.
So there was a little girl and her father.
The little girl had a cat.
One day they opened the door a little bit.
The cat ran out.
So the little girl got on her tricycle and began to go really really fast and and try to chase the cat.
But she she could not get it.
So the cat then ran up a tree.
So she figured she had to go get her dad to help.
So she goes back.
She says.
Dad my cat ran out.
It got stuck up a tree.
I need your help.
So he then follows her on her her trike.
She is riding her trike.
He is following with a ladder.
They she points.
She says.
All of a sudden he hears a a dog barking.
So he just quickly runs up the tree anyway.
Then now he cannot get down bebecause his ladder's on the ground.
So the little girl calls the fire department to help get her cat and her dad out of the tree.
I have.
I would say yeah.
As i tell it should i be flipping through it?
So there was a man who had a daughter.
Then her mother passed away.
Her father remarried a woman who was very mean to her.
This woman had two daughters her age.
So her they became her stepsisters.
Then eventually her her father passed away.
They began to call her cinderella because she they treated her so poorly.
She hadta do all the chores and stuff.
So she was covered in cinder.
I i do not know if that is the disney movie.
But i know that is the original story.
So so as she is growing up she is forced to do all these chores.
She is she is mistreated.
She kind of looks at the castle.
She dreams of you know kind of going and meeting the prince and living a better life.
So one day they the castle decides that they the prince needs to marry and needs needs a princess.
So they decided to have a ball for him to meet someone to marry.
Her household gets an invitation.
So cinderella gets excited and learns to sew and sews a really pretty dress and a a really pretty necklace.
She gets all her chores done and gets ready to go to the ball.
Then her stepsisters decide.
Well they do not want her to go.
They do not like her.
They mistreat her.
So they tear up her dress and ruin everything.
So now she cannot go to the ball.
They dress up.
They go without her.
While she is crying her fairy godmother appears.
All throughout this i am sure they are singing a bunch of random songs that i do not know.
So she makes cinderella a really pretty dress with glass slippers.
The whole while while cinderella was growing up without any friends she befriended her household animals like the mice and the horses and and whatnot.
So the fairy godmother turns turns them all into a really nice carriage.
The carriage is made out of the pumpkin.
A horse become really beautiful white horses.
They take her and her dress ball.
But she has to be back by midnight or everything will turn back to normal.
The carriage will turn back into a pumpkin.
So she goes to the ball.
People do not recognize her.
She dances with the prince.
Then all of a sudden she realizes the clock is about to strike midnight.
So she runs away.
She loses a glass slipper while she is running away.
So yeah halfway back from what i remember.
The carriage turns back into a pumpkin.
She turns back into her her ripped dress.
But the one glass slipper she still has stays the same.
She had this great night.
Then the prince comes sending all of his his men and guards looking for cinderella by seeing if whose foot the glass slipper fits.
So cinderella's stepsisters end up locking her away.
Then her mice friends bring her a key to get her out of there.
The prince's servant comes with the glass slipper to put it on cinderella.
As he is running and seeing if there is another girl who has not tried the slipper on in the town the stepmother trips him.
Everyone is all sad because he will never find his girl.
Well i have the other glass slipper.
It fits.
So and then they are the prince finds her.
They get married.
So first i would gather all of the ingredients.
So i would get the bread from the cabinet and the peanut butter from the cabinet and then the jelly from the fridge and a plate and knife.
I would take the peanut butter and put peanut butter with the knife on one slice of the bread.
Then i would take the other slice of the bread and put jelly on that side.
Then i would put the jelly slice on top of the peanut butter slice and then cut it diagonally.
Well this looks like there is going to be a little bit of a disaster.
It looks like he was chasing the cat up there trying to get the cat down.
Dog's barking at the bottom of the tree bebecause the cat are not coming down.
Dad's just sitting there going.
Then must be his daughter who is trying to catch the cat in case he does fall down.
Yeah evidently dad lost his ladder.
The firemen are coming.
They are coming with a ladder.
Hopefully they get ththem all down and everything is okay.
Okay you get the peanut butter and jelly.
You get the peanut butter and jelly.
You set it on the counter.
You get your bread.
Then you put the bread on the plate.
Then you get a knife.
Then say you start with the peanut butter.
So you open up the jar of peanut butter.
Then you spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread.
Then you open up the jelly jar.
You spread on one side the jelly.
You can either cut it or eat it whole.
I do not know.
It looks like after a flood.
I would venture to guess that this would be a rescue person who is hanging on a tree limb trying to get to her.
He is got his life jacket on and stuff like that.
They are really really struggling in this water that is just like terminal.
He is really trying to get a hold of her there and trying to get her going.
I could not tell you what the end of it is.
He are not got her out yet but it looks like they are going to manage to do this.
He is playing and having a good time and all that and everything.
He kicks the ball.
It goes through a window.
He is probably going.
There is in the home you can see the ball coming through.
Lands break the lamp.
A gentleman is sitting in a chair.
It is coming through there.
He is standing up of course looking out the window with the ball in his hand trying to figure out who and where this ball came through.
So i would imagine the ending would be he is going to go out and the boy's going to be in trouble.
He is got his backpack on.
His mom's got the umbrella in her hand because she is saying.
It probably will rain.
You needta take this umbrella with you.
The boy is saying.
It is not going to rain.
So he leaves the house without the umbrella.
So as he is walking along to school it starts to rain.
He is going.
Then it is really starting to rain a lot harder.
I mean there is even puddles.
Now he is running back home.
He went in his house.
His mom looks like.
Well see i told you.
It was going to rain.
You needed an umbrella.
He is standing there looking just drenched and patheticlike.
I am not as tough as i thought i was.
So and then he is leaving again with the umbrella.
He is happily walking in the rain now.
At least he is not getting wet.
She had a stepmother and two stepsisters.
But the stepmother treated the stepsisters very good and treated her very bad.
I mean she hadta clean everything.
She hadta do all the work.
She was just treated no good.
So that is the way it went all the time.
There was nothing she could do about it.
But she enjoyed the the animals.
Did what she was sposta do.
Then there was a ball coming up that they were all invited to the whole family.
But the stepmother would not let her go.
She said she hadta stay home and clean the fireplace and do chores and that she could not go.
It did not matter.
So while the the stepmother and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go and got all new dresses and jewelry and you know were getting all ready to go to it she got really sad.
Then so the stepmom and two stepsisters left to go to the ball.
It was actually a king's ball but i mean you know.
So she went outside.
I believe she was probably crying.
Then the fairy godmother came along and was sitting out in the garden and everything.
You know do you want to go?
We will make it so you can go and everything.
I will fix everything with my magic wand.
Anyway and so she waved her wand at cinderella.
"She had this beautiful dress that you know appeared on her, and beautiful shoes, and her hair in the little."
I cannot think of what that thing is.
Then she they went outside.
They turned the mice and pumpkins into this great big beautiful carriage with horses and with a pumpkin carriage and everything for her to go and you know.
So she got in the carriage.
But the fairy godmother said.
You hafta be back by twelve midnight.
"You know, you really hafta be back."
She looked so beautiful and everything.
She was going to have a good time and everything.
They went on to the ball at the king's palace and all that.
Then she met the prince.
They danced.
They just really really liked each other very very much.
You could tell.
Then it rang at twelve midnight.
I got to go.
I got to go.
I do not want you to go.
She you know ran down the steps to get to her you know coach and that.
She dropped one shoe.
So she dropped one and he picked it up.
Then she was gone you know.
I mean she hadta get home.
Everything turned back to normal.
She was just to herself while she was doing her chores you know.
They they were going all over the town looking for whoever this shoe should belong to you know the glass slipper actually.
They were trying it on everybody.
Of course they tried it on the stepsisters.
You know there is no way they could cram their foot in there.
They it did not fit either one of them.
Then they said.
Well then who is she you know?
You do not hafta do it for her.
He said.
No we are going to try everybody.
So she sat down.
The prince tried on the slipper.
It fit.
I think that they are all going to have a stroke or something you know.
They got married and live lived happily ever after.
The kitty went up in the tree and will not come down.
Dad tried to rescue the kitty because their daughter is missing her kitten.
The dog is enjoying joining in also.
Will the firemen rescue both of them safely?
Firemen always do.
Take out two slices of bread from the package that is sitting on the counter.
"Then put the two together, peanut butter and jelly facing each other."
Can i keep looking at it?
A woman for some reason fell.
What she was doing in the river does not show.
However she is being sucked into this whirlpool.
The rescue squad has gone in to rescue her.
As you can see he does have his life vest on.
Is holding on to a branch that hopefully will hold both of them.
Since he is well trained in his profession he will grab her and get her out of the river safe but more than a little wet.
"Playing, no school to worry about."
Looks like the lamp is broken the window is broken.
The man has my ball.
What is going to happen now?
Time to get going to school.
Looks like it is going to rain.
I do not need an umbrella.
It is raining.
It is raining heavily.
Mom mom i need my umbrella.
Okay i told you you needed to take the umbrella.
He decided it was time that he got took a wife for himself and got a mother for cinderella bebecause she needed a woman as she was growing up.
She needed a mother.
So he married a widow.
A lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters.
The woman who was cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her.
She banished her to the kitchen to do lots of chores lots of jobs.
"Her her own two little girls, who were really nasty little brats, got to sit around, get lots of new clothes, and do nothing all day long while cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked."
But she had her little cat who she loved.
The cat kept her hompany and helped as much as she could.
This went on.
He did not know what was going on.
"So he blithely went along his way enjoying his wife, his two stepchildren, and every once in awhile seeing his daughter who was so sweet and did not complain to daddy."
Meanwhile in this kingdom that they lived so long ago and far away the king and queen decided that their oldest son needed to get married.
So they planned a great ball.
"They sent out a herald, that is a messenger, who told everyone throughout the land that all the single girls were to come."
All the single young women because they hadta be old enough to get married.
So the stepmother heard about this.
Was very very excited because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince.
She plotted and planned and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get.
Meanwhile poor cinderella was not going to get to go.
Her stepmother said.
You hafta help me get the girls ready and dressed.
Then you have work to do.
You hafta keep this house clean.
You hafta make sure that it is spick and span when the prince comes to claim his bride.
After the girls and their stepmother left for the ball she sat and sat and cried.
She wanted to go to this fancy party also.
All of a sudden a light started shining.
A balloon came down.
It got bigger and bigger and brighter.
She heard a giggle.
She looked.
Why are you crying cinderella?
Because i want to go to the ball to this fancy party where the prince is going to be and dance with everybody.
Well we will hafta see about that.
By the way just so you know i am your fairy godmother.
I am going to help you see get to the ball.
Now let us see.
We got to get you a coach.
We got to get you some clothes.
Now cinderella you go outside and get me a pumpkin.
There should be some since this is still the season for growing them.
We need you to get you some clothes.
Well we will worry about that eventually.
Now outside we go.
Went outside and she took her wand said some funny little words and lo and behold there was this great big orange coach.
How 0aux we going to get this to go?
Hafta do something.
Horses worked before that.
Few more magic words we had this beautiful horse.
Now we need a coachman.
You will do nicely.
But i cannot go in these rags.
Yeah we got to do something about you.
Said a few more magic words and lo and behold there was cinderella in a gorgeous gown.
Her hair beautifully combed.
Okay now you hafta understand.
My magic only works a little bit or for a little bit of time.
But remember when the clock strikes twelve everything goes back to the way it was.
Okay i will remember.
Off she goes.
The prince sees her and dances with her.
Everybody is wondering.
The stepsisters do not recognize her.
The stepmother does not recognize her.
They have never seen her so nice and pretty and clean and all dressed up.
Cinderella is having a wonderful time.
But all of a sudden the clock starts to strike twelve.
Oh she remembers.
But the prince is so startled he does not realize what is happening.
She gets all the way out from the palace before the clock finished striking.
The coach disappears.
The beautiful dress disappears.
But as she had been running she lost her shoe.
Now for some reason it does not change back.
Before you ask me why that does not happen.
I had kids who asked questions.
So she keeps running.
Eventually she gets home.
The prince has only the shoe.
But he has fallen in love with cinderella.
A proclamation goes out the next day.
He wishes to see every young woman in the kingdom.
Whoever's foot that glass slipper fits will be his bride.
So he goes around to all the.
So his messenger goes all around the country trying it on.
Older stepsister tries it on.
Her mother tries and they push and they push and it does not fit.
The other sister says tries.
They push and they squeeze and they push and they squeeze.
They still cannot get her foot in there.
Messenger says.
I have tried everybody in the kingdom.
There is nobody else in here.
At that point cinderella peeks around the corner and the messenger sees her.
Let me try.
We have got to try her.
The prince says everybody.
Even though the stepmother is saying.
So cinderella comes in the room.
The messenger says.
I have found the prince's princess.
The prince comes to claim cinderella.
They get married and live happily ever after.
Yes the stepsisters mended their ways and really became nice girls instead of the mean spiteful ones they had been.
This is an emergency rescue red which means it is fire.
The the emergency worker has caught on to a tree branch where the child.
I do not know what the woman is hanging on to or is part of.
I can only see one hand of hers.
It is obviously an attempt to rescue the young woman.
But i you can see her head her part of her shoulders and one hand.
We do not know whether it was successful or not.
In picture number two that soccer ball has flown through the window.
There is a man sitting in a chair beside the lamp that has been knocked over looking very startled.
The fourth window is the man standing up looking out the broken window back out into the yard with the soccer ball in his hand.
He has his backpack on.
He is waving goodbye.
She is holding an umbrella out to him.
He is saying waving with his hands saying.
He does not want that.
Picture number two he is now out the door waving goodbye to his mother who is still standing looking at him holding the umbrella.
Picture number three he is now walking to school with his backpack on.
It is starting to rain.
Picture number four it is now starting to rain hard.
He has turned around is running through puddles back home in the hard rain with his hands held up over his head.
Picture number five has mother looking very disgusted with her hands on her hips looking down at small boy still with his backpack on who is now sopping wet.
Picture number six is small boy again walking to school this time with an umbrella.
The first scene is the new stepmother with the two young stepsisters coming in to meet cinderella and her widowed father.
Having relegated cinderella out to the barn they she is looking outside out of her window in the barn towards the castle.
In the next scene the wicked stepsisters and the stepmother have received.
The next scene is the king talking to the prince saying.
You must find someone to marry.
The next scene is this wicked stepsisters and the stepmother receiving a letter and an invitation to the ball at the castle at the invitation of the prince.
Cinderella is told she is not going and she is not going to be invited.
She is looking at a picture book and there are two dresses laying on the bed and the dresser but they are not the dresses in the next scene that the wicked stepsisters have on to go to the ball.
But they go on and go to the ball.
Cinderella is left at home by the hearth with the mice when her fairy godmother appears.
Cinderella becomes splendid in a beautiful white dress and a white headband.
They start off to the palace with cinderella in the carriage.
She goes into the palace.
The next time the stepsisters see her this beautiful woman who they do not recognize is dancing with the prince.
She only has until twelve of the clock before everything changes back that the fairy godmother gave her.
"So she runs out of the palace, leaving the glass slipper on the stairway."
She goes out of the palace.
They go back home.
But the prince finds the slipper on the stairway and began this search for the young woman who can wear that slipper.
When they get to the wicked stepmother's house the stepmother has a cane in her hand.
Anyway she is tripping up the man who has the slipper on a pillow.
But the prince gets still gets around to trying the slipper on cinderella and it fits.
They go off to the palace and live happily ever after.
Okay i can start.
The little girl has found her kitty is up in 0det branch of a tree.
Daddy has already climbed up into the branch to try and get the cat down.
The dog is at the bottom barking his head off at the father and the cat.
There is a bird sitting on the tree ignoring everything.
There is more?
Go in the refrigerator and get two slices of bread from the whole wheat bread because that is where i keep the bread.
I go to the cabinet that is to the left of the sink.
In the drawer down on the left is the knife that i spread the peanut butter with.
On the left hand slice of bread i spread peanut butter.
On the right hand slice i put the apricot.
I put them together and cut it.
Well first you need bread.
You need peanut butter.
You need jelly.
You need a knife.
So i would take two slices of bread.
I would put them on the bread board.
On one side i would spread peanut butter.
On the side i would spread jelly.
Because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place.
So then i pick up the peanut butter half because it sticks to the bread better than jelly.
Cut it in four pieces because my my little girl likes four pieces.
Then i put it on a plate.
I serve her.
I am going back to my kids.
Her younger sister's already retired.
What we going to do now.
Here we have what what appears to be an emergency.
How do we know this?
Because we have a fire truck on the street and that goes by this large tree.
Two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder.
So we look at the tree.
We have a dog barking up the tree.
Bark bark bark barking at?
Well there is a little bird up there but he is not barking at the bird.
We see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree.
What is he doing up there?
So we look a little further and we see a kitty cat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man.
Beneath the kitty cat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying.
Come kitty come down.
Now this this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree.
Dad went up after the kitty cat.
Got stuck up there.
The dog is yelping.
He is barking.
Someone called the firemen.
Then they are coming to rescue first the father and then the kitty cat.
It is a happy ending bebecause the little girl gets her kitty cat back.
It clearly is in water because the man who appears to be rescuing the young lady is wearing a buoyancy vest.
What i cannot make out is whether she.
It looks like she she got caught in a flood possibly.
She has grabbed a branch that has stuck out into the raging waters.
That is what it is i bet you.
She is clinging to this branch for dear life.
He is trying to get her and bring her to shore.
Did i make it up good?
I could not figure out what was going on there for a minute.
The first one shows a youngster about eight or nine having a wonderful time kicking what looks to be a volleyball.
We do not know whether it is his window or whether it is a neighbor's window.
"But as luck would have it, it breaks the window, goes through, knocks a lamp over, probably breaks the lamp."
Yes it does.
There is a gentleman sitting in the chair right next to the lamp.
Now we do not know whether this is this boy's father or whether it is a neighbor.
But the gentleman stands up.
He picks up the volleyball.
Stands looking out through the hole in his window.
But he is going to do something.
But we do not really know.
In the first picture we have little boy setting setting off for school.
He is ready to go and mom pulls out an umbrella.
Nah i do not want an umbrella.
I do not need an umbrella.
She says.
So she keeps the umbrella and he heads off.
It is not raining.
He says goodbye.
He starts off to school.
Little drip drip drip starts.
We have a little downpour.
So little boy thinks maybe he was too hasty turning down the umbrella.
She is looking down with that “i told you so” look that mothers have.
He is standing there soaking wet.
Next picture he is smiling going back to school and he has his umbrella.
Once upon a time a long time ago there was a beautiful little girl whose mother died.
So her father married giving her a stepmother.
The new stepmother had two daughters.
The stepmom did not treat cinderella very well.
She did not treat her like she did her own daughters.
She made her do all the laundry.
She made them do all the housework.
It looks to me like she slept out in the barn with the horses.
But she liked horses and she liked the dogs and she liked all the animals.
So they liked her so she did not care.
Well one day she was looking out the window at the castle.
"She could see that it was far away, that it was in the distance."
Word came that the king was very angry with his son prince because he was not in any hurry to get married to take a queen.
So the king says.
He sent out an.
His son would meet all of the eligible young ladies in the kingdom.
There would be a way that one would be chosen from this ball.
Cinderella thought.
So she dug in her trunk and she found bits and pieces.
She made a beautiful well very beautiful dress.
Was not fancy really but she was pretty girl it looked beautiful on her.
So she thought she could go to the ball bebecause she was certainly one of the members of the of the kingdom.
Two stepsisters came in.
"No way are you going, bitch."
So they ripped off her gold necklace and tore her dress off and said.
So she went back into the scullery.
There sitting on a big trunk was someone who looked very much like a fairy godmother.
She had a wand and everything.
She took the story and she says.
Yes you shall go to the ball.
You shall have footmen.
They are going to be your footmen.
It is going to be your carriage.
You see this dress?
She could not believe this was happening.
She did not really know it was but she was all ready to go.
She got into the carriage.
She had gorgeous horses.
They drove her right up castle.
When they helped her down wow she made an entrance.
The prince took one look at her and he thought.
He did not say that.
He he thought it.
So he is dancing with her.
She was told.
You have got til midnight.
She sees the clock.
She races out of the ballroom.
The prince says.
Where are you going?
He starts following her.
She races down the stairs and jumps into her coach and they race home.
Then there she is in her regular clothes sitting on a pumpkin with her little mice around her.
But as she was running down the stairs she lost one of her glass slippers.
The prince saw it.
He said.
This is the slipper from the most beautiful woman in the kingdom and i am going to find her.
So that began the search.
They went to every house in the kingdom.
Noone could fit their big fat foot into that pretty little glass slipper.
Went to cinderella's home where cinderella was nowhere to be seen.
Two ugly stepsisters they tried to push it and they shove it.
They could not get their any part of their foot in that little slipper.
Well finally they admitted that she was in the scullery but she you know.
He was going to put it on.
So he put the slipper on.
It fit like a slipper.
He was so happy he would found the girl of his dreams.
If you can see what happened.
The next few pictures show us them going off to their wedding in a dress and her beautiful carriage.
As they say they lived happily ever after.
She was calling for help.
They called the fire department to come and rescue her.
The fireman put on a inflatable vest.
He had a tree limb that he was holding onto.
Trying to help her out of the swirling water.
Which he was successfully able to do because of the team that helped him as he wrapped the belt around his arm and around her to help pull her out of the water.
So she was not hurt.
Young boy was playing soccer.
He hit kicked the ball.
It went through the window.
The man inside was very upset because it not only did it break the window but it knocked over the lamp.
Glass shattered all over the living room where he was sitting.
Then he picked up the ball and looked out the window to discover that it was his son.
So he called him inside and said.
How are we going to take care of this?
The boy agreed that he would pay for the window out of his allowance.
He said.
He did not need it.
But he got halfway there.
Realized that it was already raining.
So he ran back in the mud puddles.
His mother made him go change clothes.
He started off with the umbrella again in dry clothes.
Cinderella had a very happy home.
But her mother died.
After a bit her father remarried.
Stepmother had two very unattractive and unpleasant daughters.
They made cinderella's life miserable.
As they grew cinderella became the the housemaid and took care of everything girls.
Did what they wanted her to.
Fetched whatever they wanted from her.
In the meantime the young prince had grown.
The father was disturbed because he had not found the princess that he wanted to marry.
So he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday.
He sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball.
So the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation.
So they got their new dresses.
Had cinderella polish and shine everything so that they would look just elegant.
So because the invitation went to everyone cinderella decided she would prepare a a dress to go too.
All the animals had helped her prepare it in the movie.
When she the time came for them all to dress and go to the ball why she helped the stepsisters get dressed.
Then she went up and put on her pretty little pink dress.
When she came down the stepsister says.
She could not go with them.
So they actually tore her dress so she could not wear it.
They got in their coach and left.
Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball.
All of a sudden her fairy godmother appeared.
She said.
I will take care of this.
I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land.
Which she did.
Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful.
But she said.
How am i going to get there?
The fairy said.
She made a coach out of the pumpkin and mice became horses.
So they carried her ball.
When she entered the prince was just dazzled by her.
He asked her to dance.
They danced again.
They danced again.
Finally it struck midnight.
She knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave before midnight.
So she dashed out of the ball.
In her hurry she lost one of her slippers glass slippers.
But unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve.
She had nothing but a pumpkin and mice.
She had lost her pretty dress.
But she still had one single glass slipper.
So she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she did not think she would ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had.
The the sisters came home.
They were talking about this strange young woman who was there.
That she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her.
They wondered who she was and how come he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once.
Then the prince was so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing cinderella.
The the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper on all all of the eligible young women.
So the stepmother said.
We have only two.
So he they tried to push their big feet into the glass slipper and it would not work.
He said.
Cinderella came out.
She said.
Even though the stepmother said.
No no no we do not have anybody else.
The envoy said.
Oh well then you must try it on.
So she pulled out the slipper that was in her pocket that she would been carrying.
I think this matches.
He slipped the other shoe on her foot.
They both fit beautifully.
He then took her back to the palace.
They had a beautiful wedding.
Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after.
You said peanut butter and jelly right?
The little girl was was very upset that her cat was trapped up there.
When the father climbed up the tree the ladder fell so he is he was stuck on the tree.
The dog is barking.
The firemen are coming to rescue him and help him down off the tree and get the cat off the tree.
Two two people are holding on to a a limb trying not to drown.
Broke shattered the glass.
It landed inside gentleman's house.
He picked the ball up and looked at the window.
The mother wanted her little boy to take the umbrella with him when he left the house.
He did not want to take it.
He left the house.
It started raining.
He got all wet.
There was a daughter and her father and he brought a stepmother into the home with her two daughters.
Apparently he passed away.
His daughter was left with the stepmother and the two stepsisters.
They used her as a maid.
She befriended all the animals in in the house.
She dreamt of going to the ball but she did not have anything nice to wear.
Her fairy godmother appeared.
She went to the ball in a pumpkin coach.
The stepmother and stepsisters did not know that this happened.
At the ball she met the prince and they fell in love.
But at midnight she hadta leave or she would revert back to the maid.
As she was running down the stairs she lost her glass slipper.
The at midnight everything turned back to the way it was.
Then the the prince was looking for her.
He sent out his servant to try the slipper on all the the young women.
He ended up at the house of cinderella.
The stepsisters tried on the slipper and it did not fit.
The mother or stepmother tried it on and it did not fit.
Then cinderella tried it on and it fit.
Then her and the prince were reunited.
They got married.
She noticed her cat was up in the tree.
So her dad went up to try to get him out.
He got stuck in the tree.
So the mother ran back to the house to call the fire department to get the dad and the cat out.
The dog is not helping.
You take out the bread.
Did you want jelly too?
Then i usually use the other side of the bread to put the jelly on.
The grandmother got swept away in the car.
The firemen were back doing one more final check before they totally evacuated.
They see this girl floating down the river.
He reaches out a branch to try to save her.
The grandmother was never found.
He is not careful and he he kicks it right through the window.
The stepdad sees the ball and it it the lamp.
He decides to punish the boy.
He will hide the ball.
He puts it in the washing machine.
Ricky's going to go to school.
His mom says.
You might need this umbrella.
It it is probably going to rain.
I do not need it.
So he takes off walking to school.
All a sudden it starts raining.
"He covers his head and runs back, getting all wet."
His mom's unhappy with him because he is gotten wet.
She he did not listen to her.
So he takes the umbrella then proceeds to school not getting any further soaked.
Oh cinderella's father marries the stepmother.
He introduces her to her daughters and the stepmother and the two stepsisters and the cat.
Then the father goes away and the they make cinderella do all the chores and all the cleaning and all the dirty work.
Then the they get an invitation to a ball.
Cinderella wants to go.
They said.
Of course you cannot go.
The sisters get dressed.
Cinderella goes into her mom's old trunk and finds an old dress.
The sisters see her.
They take it away and say.
You cannot go.
You hafta stay here and do all our dirty work.
So they go to the ball.
Then the fairy godmother shows up and dresses her up.

That she could go to the ball but she would hafta be back from midnight.
So she you know has the magic wand and she is dressed in this beautiful dress.
She dances with prince charming while the wicked stepsisters are looking in you know in horror and anger.
So when it strikes midnight she hasta get into this carriage carriage and be home.
But she in the meantime she is rushing so fast she she drops one of her shoes.
So she goes home.
Meanwhile prince charming is trying.
Then she is transformed into with the poor you know dress and everything.
Meanwhile he is trying to find who the shoe belonged to because he wanted to be back with her to live happily ever after.

She noticed the cat was up in a tree.
She had been riding her tricycle along the neighborhood and noticed that her cat was in the tree.
Meanwhile the dog is barking because the man is in the tree and also the cat.
It looks like the man is afraid of heights.
So they call the fire department.
The fire department came and rescued the cat and mary's father.
The dog starts barking.
They went home.
I love magazines too.

Unfortunately a woman drove along a road that was flooded.
Her car stalled.
The water level rose rapidly.

She got out and jumped in the water.
Started going down the rushing water.
The rushing water caught her.
She got lucky and it she landed on a branch.
Some firemen came to rescue her.
They rescued her without injuries.
He accidentally kicked it through his neighbor's window.
It broke the glass as well as went all the way through the window and struck into a man's lap sitting in his recliner chair.
He looked out the window and to see who it was.
Finish make a beginning and end?
After the man had the soccer ball he went out to see who it was.
Johnny said.
He said.
You should have your parents pay to have the window fixed.
A young lady wanted to go for a walk one day.
Her mother gave an an umbrella yet she did not want to use it.
She was walking along down the street down to a supermarket.
It began raining.
Oh that is not what the picture says.

One day a young girl wanted to go down to the supermarket.
Her mother said it might rain today.
She gave an umbrella.
The girl refused the umbrella.
It began raining.
She then returned home and was soaking wet.
She came back.
Her mother gave the umbrella.
Then she went back out.
This is the story about cinderella a nice young lady who wanted to go to the ball but she had lived with an evil stepmom and three evil stepsisters.
She was made to clean the house while the stepsisters got ready for the ball.
Somehow she found an invitation to go to the ball or someone invited her.
She went to the ball and looked very pretty.
Up suddenly a prince rode up and said.
I am looking for this person who is sposta be my princess.
I know it is her if her foot fits in the shoe.
He came over and tried the shoe on cinderella.
They went off and she became a gold digger and rescued.
They settle down.
There is a little girl and she was playing outside with her bike and her cat.
The cat got up in the tree.
She could not get him to come back down.
So her dad went out to try and help.
Got the ladder climbed the tree.
Then the ladder fell over.
So he is now stuck in the tree with the cat.
The dog is barking.
But he cannot really climb the tree to help.
So the firemen have showed up with a tall ladder to save the man and the cat.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need some really good high quality sprouted grain bread.
Maybe something like ezekiel's if you are still eating bread.
So then you would take two slices.
You want to get a nice high quality peanut butter.
Then you can spread the peanut butter on one slice.
Then for your jelly you could actually use a preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself so it is got really pure high quality ingredients.
You would just place some of that on the other slice.
Then you would introduce the two slices to each other.
You have a sandwich.
So there is a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better.
He still has not quite learned.
So as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house.
There is a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened.
So there is a little boy getting ready for school.
His mom comes up and says.
Do not you want to take your umbrella?
He says.
He is asserting his independence and making decisions for himself.
So he does not want to take his mother's good advice.
He goes out for the day and realizes that it is raining raining very very hard.
There are puddles everywhere.
So he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels a lot better bebecause now he has some weather protection.
So there is a little girl whose mother has died.
So her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her.
So she is introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters.
But it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean.
So all the years as she is raised with them during the beginning few years it is it is okay.
Then her father dies.
She is left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters.
They basically make her to be a maid.
She hasta do all the work on the farm.
She hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food.
So there is also in the same area a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle.
The king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince.
So he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region.
So an invitation for a ball so that the prince can choose a bride.
They get this invitation at cinderella's house.
The stepmother reads it.
They want to go meet this handsome prince.
They are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess.
So they get ready for the ball.
Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball.
She wants to go dance and have fun.
So she hangs out with all her little animal friends and is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball.
When she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that she is not allowed to go.
She is not going to go.
They rip off all of her jewelry.
They tear apart her dress.
They leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as well.
She does not know what to do.
Then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she is going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny.
"So she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride, creates a beautiful dress for her, gives her these delightful glass slippers, and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball."
But she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was.
So cinderella goes and is very excited.
As soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night.
They do not know who this woman even is.
She is having a great time.
But then she realizes that this the clock is about to strike.
So she runs in such a hurry.
The prince goes after her like.
You cannot leave.
Why are you leaving?
She just says.
I hafta go.
She leaves.
But one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind.
He holds on to this shoe and takes it to the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe.
So cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe.
They are trying the shoe on everyone in the house.
But it does not fit the fat foot of the sister.
It does not fit the fat foot of the other sister.
It sure does not fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother.
But it does fit the foot of cinderella.
So they know that she is the one that was at the party.
She goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after.
I would open the jar of peanut butter.
Then we get a spoon and and take some jelly out of the jar and spread it peanut buttered slice of bread.
It looks like the family caught cat got caught tree limb.
The father goes up the tree to to rescue the the cat.
He goes up a ladder.
And while he is up there ladder fell away from the tree.
The dog is barking.
A little girl that is his daughter is trying to coax a cat to come down.
Somebody had called the firemen to come out and rescue the father.
This little boy is playing out in the yard.
It goes right through the window of this this house.
It knocks over a lamp in this living room.
I do not know if it is his house or if it is a neighbor's.
But anyway the man looked like he was kind of upset.
He picks up the ball.
He looks at the hole in the window.
And he is he is probably perturbed.
That is about it i think.
Looks like this little boy is is getting ready to go someplace.
His mother says.
You better take this umbrella.
The little boy just waves waves and.
Well nah i do not need the umbrella.
So he goes out for his walk or to school or wherever.
Sure enough he gets caught in the rain and goes inside.
He looks like he is kind of down in the dumps.
His mother is frowning at him saying.
I told you take the umbrella.
So this time he does take the umbrella and walks out in the rain.
"She was always envious of the rich, the people that had a lot more than she had."
She wanted to go to this ball.
I forget how the shoe is involved.
I believe she danced with this prince.
I believe she was told that if this shoe would fit her she would be accepted.
It did fit her.
So a little girl lost her cat up the tree and then could not get the cat out of the tree.
So there was a.
The neighbor said.
Oh i will come over and get your cat out of the tree.
When he got up in the tree he realized he could not get to the cat.
Meanwhile the dog came along and knocked the ladder over and started barking at him.
He got scared.
So finally another neighbor hadta call the fire department so they could save the cat and the guy in the tree.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you needta have a loaf of bread peanut butter and jelly.
You untwist the bag of the bread.

So there was a young boy who decided to go out and practice his soccer game.
While he was out practicing he kicked the soccer ball into the neighbor's window.
The neighbor was at home while this happened.
Freaked him out because a ball came flying through his window and crashed.

He is all soaking wet.
His mother's just furious that he is all soaking wet bebecause he did not take the umbrella.
Now he came back.
So he is going to be late for school.

I will take the umbrella.
The mother was happy that the boy finally listened to his mother.
The boy made it to school walking to school without getting wet because he used the umbrella like his mom told him in the first place.

It was like a dream come true.
But the fairy godmother said.

I do not like these.
Well come on there is two more there.
She was having a good time until she noticed that the dog was barking at the tree.
She looked up into the tree and there she saw her cat muffy sitting way out on a branch.
Muffy looked happy enough.
Muffy did not look concerned.
But the little girl thought that muffy was going to fall.
So she called to her father.
He climbed out on the branch.
But then he got scared bebecause he was afraid of heights.
He could not go any further.
He was immobilized.
The dog barking at the base of the tree accidentally knocked the ladder down.
Dad was stuck.
Now there was dad and muffy up in the tree.
Suzie did not know what to do.
Mother looking out the window saw what was happening.
She called the fire department.
The fire department came racing in with their fire engine.
They unloaded their own ladder.
They put the ladder against the tree.
First they helped father down.
Then they reached up and very gently took the cat and brought the kitty cat back down to suzie.
The cat purred.
It had been raining for days and days.
The creeks were flooding.
The there were roads that were impassable.
There were roadblocks up everywhere.
But every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads.
They do not realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water.
That it is much deeper than they realized.
One father had attempted to cross the road.
He thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine.
Then as they entered the water very quickly the current pushed against the upstream side of the truck.
Then he climbed to the top of the truck.
Over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter.
The water swept them off the top of the truck.
Were swept downstream they caught a tree.
The girl hung on to the tree alone because her father had been swept further down.
He hadta grab another tree down the way.
Someone watching who had seen everything had called nineoneone.
The fire department got there.
They saw the little girl clinging to the tree.
One particularly strong handsome young fire fighter put on his life vest.
She clung to him knowing that her life depended on it.
He held her very tightly while he put another belt around her.
It was a belt similar to the one he was wearing.
They they tied themselves together with the belt.
"His friends back on shore, the other fire fighters, pulled him back to the shore with the girl."
When she was safe a different fire fighter went in after the father.
They gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law.
He got a bill for fifteen hundred dollars for the rescue of him and his daughter.
He was having a great time kicking the ball around practicing all his soccer moves.
Thinking about how cool he was going to be in the upcoming soccer tournament.
How he was going to be the star.
He was excited thinking about all the glory that he was going to receive.
He gave that soccer ball the biggest kick he could.
There it went straight for his living room window.
Knocked over and flew into his father's lap who was sitting just inside taking a nap in his favorite chair.
"Shocked, the father stood up."
Looked outside the window to see what had happened.
There was no little boy.
But he knew.
He waited until the boy came home.
When he did come home the father scolded him.
Gave him a list of jobs he would hafta do to earn the money to pay for the broken window.
The weathermen had said it was going to rain that day.
So mom asked billy to take an umbrella.
Billy said.
I do not want to take an umbrella.
So mom said.
If you are sure you do not hafta take the umbrella.
A little ways away from his house the rain started to fall.
Within seconds it was coming down like cats and dogs.
He turned around and ran as fast as he could through the growing puddles back to his house.
When he got to his house he was soaking sopping wet.
His mother just looked at him and shook her head.
He changed his clothes.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella.
Her mother had died.
Her father married a new wife who had two children of her own.
They came to live in cinderella's house with cinderella and her father.
"Her new stepmother and the stepmother's two daughters, cinderella's stepsisters now, did not like cinderella because she was so beautiful."
The stepmother decided that cinderella would be like a maid.
She made cinderella do all kinds of work.
She made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning.
She hadta serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters.
One day an invitation came.
The prince was having a ball.
All the eligible women in the city were invited to the ball.
They started planning right away for the ball.
Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she could not go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs.
The stepmother gave her a particularly long list of of very long difficult dirty jobs knowing that cinderella would never be able to finish them in order to go to the ball.
She went in her room and cried.
Her animal friends gathered around her.
The animals loved her.
The animals helped her do her chores.
They all worked very hard.
They put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball.
When it was time to go to the ball she went downstairs.
When the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress they just went crazy with rage.
"They tore the dress off of her, the pins out of her hair."
They pushed her down.
Told her that she did not deserve to come to the ball.
"Crying, she went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her."
Then fairy godmother appeared.
With a wave of her wand the fairy godmother produced a dress for cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen.
Cinderella looked beautiful.
The fairy godmother said that cinderella was to go to the ball.
But she hadta be back home by midnight.
Because at midnight her clothes and her carriage and everything were going to disappear and go back to normal.
So she took some mice and with a wave of her wand she turned them into horses.
Cinderella climbed in in her beautiful gown and went to the ball.
Everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom.
The prince fell in love immediately.
They danced all night.
She was having such a good time cinderella was she did not realize how late it was.
As the clock struck the first bell for twelve of the clock she looked up and realized how late it was and what was going to happen.
"With a gasp she ran out of the ballroom, leaving the prince shocked not knowing what was going on."
She ran out of the ballroom and down the stairs.
She hadta get out of there before the last bong.
On the way down the steps she tripped and lost a slipper.
She made it home.
All the beautiful dresses and pumpkin coach and horses turned back into what they had been before the fairy godmother visited.
So she had made it home safely without anybody quite figuring out who she was.
The prince was not happy because he did not know who she was where she lived.
He did not know when he was going to see her again.
So he took the glass slipper and had his his servant go to every house in the city.
All the girls hadta try on the slipper.
He knew that whoever the slipper fit was going to be the girl who he had fallen in love with at the ball.
The two stepsisters tried to fit their feet into the slipper but their feet were too big.
The servant said.
I have searched all the houses.
There has got to be somebody else.
Just then cinderella appeared in her work dress.
He says.
She needs to try on the slipper too.
So cinderella placed her foot into the slipper.
It slid in very easily.
She smiled.
The servant smiled and said.
At last i found you.
He brought cinderella back to the castle.
While the sisters stared after her with anger in their eyes.
The prince was very happy that his servant had found cinderella.
When they got married cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them.
They all lived happily ever after.
The little girl is outside playing on her tricycle when she hears her cat meowing.
She looks around and she sees the cat up in the tree.
She can tell scared and cannot get out of the tree.
So she goes to get her father.
He climbs the tree to go get the cat.
Then he gets stuck.
The dog is barking at the dad to get out of the tree.
He cannot get the dad down.
So meanwhile mom calls the fire department while the cat and the dad are stuck in the tree.
The little girl is trying to reach the cat and the dog is trying to reach the dad.
Just in time the fire department pulls up with their ladder and gets everyone out of the tree.
You get two slices of bread a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly.
You lay the slices flat on a plate.
You put peanut butter on both sides.
Then you smear some jelly on both sides.
You put the two slices together.
A woman had gotten stuck in flood waters in arizona and she could not get out.
She was hanging onto a tree limb.
So one of the policemen who were helping with the rescue decide to have them tie a strap on him so he could swim out to her and rescue her.
Held her as tight as he could so she would not slip loose in the flood waters.
The the rest of his team pulled him in by the rope.
Then it went through the front window of his house where dad was sitting watching t v.
It the ball came through the window.
He looked out the window and saw jimmy standing there looking upset.
Dad said.
We can fix it.
But you will just hafta pay it off by mowing the lawn.
As tyler's leaving out the door to go to school his mom says.
Tyler you better take your umbrella.
Tyler says.
Mom i do not need no umbrella.
So tyler starts walking to school and here comes the rain.
It starts to rain.
Oh no it is raining.
He runs back home soaking wet.
Comes into the door dripping wet.
I told you tyler take your umbrella.
So tyler takes his umbrella and starts his way back to school with his umbrella in the rain.
When cinderella was a child her father had remarried after her mother had passed away.
Her new stepmother and two stepsisters moved in with them.
The as they got old the stepsisters became meaner and meaner to cinderella making her do all the household chores and doing everything for them.
Cinderella had no life of her own so spent a lot of time with the farm animals telling them stories of how she would like to meet prince charming.
Then one day it was announced that prince charming would be holding a ball to try to find a wife.
So cinderella got exciting excited saying she would go to the ball and make a beautiful dress and meet prince charming.
At the same time the stepsisters were getting ready for the ball also.
Talking of how they would marry prince charming and live a wonderful with him too.
So the night of the ball cinderella puts on the beautiful pink dress she had made put on some jewelry and did her hair and was walking out when the stepsisters said.
Where do you think you are going?
Cinderella says.
I am going to the ball.
They ripped her dress to pieces and tore her jewelry off and messed up her hair so she could not go to the ball.
As they laughed and walked out the door and headed to the ball without her.
Cinderella was so upset that she could not go to the ball any longer.
She sat outside and cried.
All of a sudden a fairy godmother came along and said.
What are you crying for?
She said.
I can no longer go to the ball.
My dress is all torn and i have nothing else to wear.
The fairy godmother said.
Let me take care of that for you.
With the wave of her wand she gave cinderella a beautiful dress and her hair was all in a beautiful hairdo and she has some beautiful glass slippers.
Cinderella said.
But now how will i get there?
So the fairy godmother says.
Well here is a coach for you to take you to the ball.
But you hafta leave at midnight or it will turn into a pumpkin.
So cinderella says.
So off to the ball she goes carriage and her beautiful dress and her glass slippers.
Cinderella gets to the ball and is in awe of how beautiful it is.
She sees prince charming.
Prince charming sees her immediately and comes over to her and asks her to dance.
So they they dance for hours.
Then cinderella hears a clock strike midnight and she gets worried.
Oh no i hafta leave.
She immediately runs out the door.
As she is running carriage she loses one of her slippers and does not have time to go grab it.
So she jumps in the carriage and the carriage takes her off off into the distance.
So when cinderella's home all she can dream about is her night at the ball and how wonderful it was.
In the meantime prince charming is wondering who this beautiful woman was and how he is going to find her.
Realizes he can take the glass slipper and find find out who it fits and that will be his girl.
So he sends his assistant off to the village to try the shoes on on all the women to see if he can find her for him.
When he gets to cinderella's house the stepsisters had heard the story of them coming to try the slipper on all the women.
So they are convinced that one of them will fit into the slipper.
When the man comes into the house and the shoe does not fit the two stepsisters he sees cinderella and says.
You have not tried the shoe on yet.
The stepmother says.
Oh that will not fit her anyhow.
The man says.
So he walks over to her with the slipper on the pillow.
As he is walking over the stepmother tries to trip him.
The shoe flies in the air.
It slides right onto her foot and fits perfectly.
That is when they realize that cinderella is the woman that prince charming is looking for.
They take her to the castle and live happily ever after.
I am going to get the bread out.
Spread spread some jam on the second bread.
You slap ththem together.
There is your peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
There is a little girl riding on her bike.
As she noticed there was a cat caught up in the tree.
She went back home.
He decided to be the hero himself and got stuck in the tree.
Now they have the dog trying to bark at his owner to come down from the tree.
Someone hadta run and call the fire department to rescue both the father and the cat.
They both are rescued.
The girl fell into rapid waters and was floating down the river.
Was able to hold onto a branch for awhile til the rescue group came to get her.
She was saved.
Looks like she was saved.
Let us see.
The boy decided to go outside and play soccer.
As he went to go to the window found nobody to be there.
It is a mystery of who hit threw the ball.
The mother warns him that it might rain.
Oh mom i do not need the umbrella.
She insists.
I do not need the umbrella.
As the boy's walking to school it starts to rain.
He runs back to the house sopping wet.
The mother basically says.
I told you so.
I do not know the beginning well as.
I think the father remarried to 0obj that already had two daughters.
I am not sure what happened to the father.
But she was raised by the stepmother with her two daughters.
They did not treat her very nicely at all.
The king had wanted to find a wife for the prince and wanted to throw a ball.
Once it was announced the sisters were all excited and cinderella thought she could go.
But they were making her do all the chores in the house.
Then when she got all the chores done she could go.
But there was no none of time.
"The mice, i remember the mice helping to make a dress for her."
I think there were birds that helped to make the dress as well.
A fairy godmother shows up.
She ends up dancing with the prince bebecause he wants to know who this lady is.
The clock strikes midnight.
She hasta leave.
As she leaves she leaves a glass slipper.
One day a girl decided to go on hike through a riverbed which was very dry at that time as it was arizona.
Then there happened to be a flash flood.
As she was walking this flood roared down through the riverbed and caught her.
She incapable of you know swimming to the shore or anything.
She was panicking and was very frightened and did not know what to do.
Eventually she the the the the the water brought her to a tree limb where she was able to grab on.
She was screaming for help.
Some people nearby heard her and called nineoneone for a rescue team to come and fetch her out of the water.
A little while later they arrived.
The man was wearing a vest.
He was tied on to the tree limb.
He had a belt attached to her.
He climbed down the tree limb attached her to the belt and pulled her out to safety.
She knew not to walk in riverbeds before flash floods.
One day tommy decided to go play soccer out in the field behind his house.
He tried to kick the ball as hard as he could.
The ball flew very far right through his living room window where his dad was sitting watching television.
The ball went through the window and also broke the lamp.
The father picked up the ball looked out the window and saw his son.
The father called the boy in and grounded him for a week.
One day tommy was preparing to go to school.
The mother said it was going to rain that day and insisted that he take an umbrella.
Tommy said.
He left.
But he left anyways.
On his way to school it began to pour down so much that he hadta run home to get that umbrella.
When he arrived at home he was sopping wet.
His mother scolded him for not taking her advice in the first place.
Then tommy took the umbrella and walked back to school.
Her mother had passed away.
Her father ended up remarrying a woman who had two daughters.
She was left with her stepsisters and stepmother.
She lived a very meager life.
The animals were the people she got along with the the creatures that she could talk to.
Then one day the there was a prince in that country.
They were going to hold a ball for him to find his wife.
As it was time for him to marry.
However cinderella could not go unless she had finished all her chores.
Her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish.
She said cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first.
So by the time it came to go cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to make a dress or prepare herself to go.
But unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters' clothes and such that they had cast away because they did not want it.
So cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her.
While the the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go.
Then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away.
They started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until cinderella was left in nothing but tatters.
She went out to the yard and was crying.
Then a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight.
She made her very beautiful and all that.
But she warned her.
It would only last til midnight.
You know she turned you know a pumpkin into a carriage and you know transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful.
So cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince.
I guess it was love at first sight.
They were dancing together.
You know he he very much enjoyed his time with her.
They were dancing outside.
She saw the clock.
She knows it is almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs leaving one of her glass slippers behind.
She went racing off in the carriage.
She actually did not make it quite home in the when it struck midnight.
Everything turned back to what it was pumpkin.
The carriage turned back into a pumpkin.
Everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers.
So this prince after this happened he was very interested in finding her.
You know he wondered why she had ran away.
So he set out to search for her using the glass slipper.
You know whoever's foot it fit would be that girl.
He sent out his i do not know it was the duke or something to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit.
Eventually that duke got to cinderella's house.
Cinderella got excited.
But the stepmother knew why she was there and locked cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was cinderella.
I do not remember how.
While her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper.
They went flying you know every time.
The animals ended up helping cinderella by fetching the key from the the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind.
She came downstairs to try on the glass slipper.
The duke began to walk over towards cinderella with the glass slipper.
The stepmother tripped him.
The glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces.
You know the duke thought that everything was over.
Everything was ruined.
They would never find her.
But just at that moment she cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity.
She ended up marrying the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
One day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat patches was in the tree stuck and was crying.
She ran home quickly to get her dad to help the cat out.
The dad brought a ladder just in case.
As they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree.
The father then climbed up the tree.
Now the father was also stuck.
Meanwhile the neighbor called nineoneone.
An a the firemen came to help him down from the tree.
First you would go to the fridge and get the bread.
You would put peanut butter on both slices bebecause i love extra peanut butter.
Then you would put jelly on both those slices.
Then if you want you could put the banana in it but it is peanut butter and jelly so i would not put banana.
I would just put the two slices together.
Milk might go better but we are good.
This well it is you can interpret a bunch of different ways.
"So let us say hurricane hits, fills up all the water and just wipes out you know kind of like the one in new orleans or something."
I do not know.
That is what i meant.
All the waters are filled.
Make a long story short houses trees everything's going down water.
It just kind of just looks like rivers now.
You know she is just all the winds and everything she is stuck in the water.
She gets stuck in the water and she is going downstream and everything's going.
Everything's going so fast.
I am not telling this as a story.
She is going downstream.
The girl's you know feeling hopeless and does not know if she is going to make it.
Out of nowhere one of the rescue teams that came in to fight the tsunami come in and they they see the girl.
A guy jumps out of the helicopter with you know a life preserver and belts and and you know all equipped and ready to save her and fly goes downstream.
He he you know slides down the water and eventually runs into the branch and grabs the branch and hooks her onto a belt.
The helicopter comes and you know drops the rope down pulls ththem out of the water.
Okay so a kid is playing soccer ball.
He is kicking it up in the air to himself messing around with the soccer ball trying to practice for the big game tomorrow.

So they fix it together.
The day ends happily.
Okay so the kid is leaving to go to school.
The mother says to the kid.

The momma gives him the umbrella.
She says it might rain.

The kid realizes that he left the umbrella with the mother because he chose not to take it.
That is what he says to her.
So upon it raining he starts running in the rain covers his head and goes.
"Runs back to the mother, asks for the umbrella and the mother kind of looks at him saying."
I told you so.
The kid's unhappy but he knows his mother is right.
"He takes the umbrella with him, walks to school gets to school safely and is then therefore not wet anymore."

"She they the mother treats her two daughters you know very well, gives her nice clothes and everything and and eventually has cinderella do all the chores around the house and everything."
You know cinderella just feels terrible.
They treat her like dirt.
Cinderella finds out about this.
The mother and two daughters will not let her go because you know they think she is ugly and she is not worthy of it.
So cinderella's all distraught and disheartened.
The girls and the mother end up getting you know all their stuff together and getting ready to go.
All the while cinderella has these animals and birds and everything.
She ends up making a dress for herself because she wants to go.
Then she meets a fairy godmother who helps her with the dress and gets her all nice and pretty.
She ends up showing up to the ball.
You know obviously her mother and the mother's two daughters are there.
For lack of better words the prince notices her and ends up dancing with her.
They have a great night but she you know ends up realizing that she hasta leave and come back before the crike clock strikes twelve as the fairy godmother told her because the rules and the magic and everything.

She gets to the magic pumpkin carriage that takes her back to her place.
It eventually all turns back to their normal things.
The carriage turns back into a pumpkin.
You know she turns back to her normal raggedy clothes and dress.

The prince just realized that he is fallen in love.
He you know hasta find the one who owns the slipper.
He sends out a big search.
They go to every you know house and place in the kingdom to find out who the one is that fits the slipper.
Nobody fits it.
When he comes to cinderella's house the mother and daughter will not let cinderella be seen nor try on the slipper.
So he leaves.
Make a long story short he comes back or something.
He finds the slipper fits cinderella.
Her and the prince get together.
He realizes that it was her who wore the slipper.
They truly fall in love and get married and live happily ever after.
So a man steps out of his house to go get the milk on the front porch because this is old times like the nineteen fifties or sixties whatever.
A dog starts chasing after him.
So he decides to run.
He cannot get in his house.
His door locked behind him.
He runs.
He goes up a tree.
As he goes up the tree the dog starts barking and tries to get him but cannot climb up the tree obviously.
He notices that there is this little girl whose cat is stuck up in the tree.
She had called the firemen to come and get the cat.
So make a long story short she gets the cat.
The dog eventually chases after the cat.
The man's able to get out of the tree.
The firemen and everyone leave.
"First you get the bread out of the cupboard, the peanut butter out of the cupboard, the jelly out of the refrigerator."

You open the jar of peanut butter.
There was a big rainstorm.
There was a lot of flooding.
Family was trying to get out of their house a or trying to get to safety.
One of the daughters got swept away in the river.
Grabbed onto a tree limb where the water was rushing and very violent.
A nice paramedic or helicopter man as they were out searching for people found where she was located or was notified where she was located.
So he hadta be lowered below and drag himself across the water so that he could rescue her.
When the ball hit the window it smashed into a lamp.
Picked up the ball and started to head out the door find out who kicked the ball through his window.
Filed a home owner's insurance claim to get his window fixed.
His mom said.

Once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella.
She had happy life with her mother and her father.
Her mother died which was sad.
She grew up.
Father decided to get remarried.
"He married a woman that had two other daughters as well, cinderella's stepsisters."
As she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her.
Her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them.
One day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married.
So the king said.
Prince we are going to have a ball so that you can meet some ladies to be married.
An invitation came to cinderella that there was going to be a ball.
So she was went to get ready for the ball.
Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as well but that cinderella could not go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done.
Which was kind of disheartening because she would not have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear.
So the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people.
She slaved away the day.
So eventually it was time to go to the ball.
Cinderella felt like she had not had time to get ready.
But then the mice showed her her dress that they had made.
She was excited because then she could go to the ball.
So she ran down the stairs to leave.
The sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart.
While the stepmother stat by and watched.
So the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince.
As she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out.
So they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress.
So she headed off.
The prince danced with a few people but saw cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really.
The fairy godmother told cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal.
So cinderella lost track of time.
She realized what would happen and so she ran.
As she was running she lost one of her slippers.
The prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was.
She was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear.
So she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper.
The king and he hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit.
They worked long and hard the prince long and hard to find the person.
When they arrived at cinderella's house the stepmother locked cinderella in a room so that she could not try on the slipper because she suspected that cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen.
The stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper.
It would not fit.
The mice snuck the key past dragon the cat to open the door to let cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say.
But wait i can try it on.
Luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on.
But cinderella produced the other slipper and said.
Well here is the matching pair.
I was the girl and it does fit.
Cinderella married the prince and they lived happily ever after.
In this picture cat climbed a tree to try and catch a bird.
The daughter knows that her cat was stuck in the tree so she went and got her dad.
The dad got stuck in the tree as well.
They hadta call the fireman to come and rescue both probably from the tree.
A woman has fallen into the water.
There is a lot of rapids.
A man wearing a life vest is trying to help the woman by putting a branch into the water for her to grab.
He has tied the branch to himself with the belt so that it does not come loose.
He kicks the ball through his parents' window.
The ball comes through the window and knocks down the lamp.
The man is very very mad and yells at the boy through the cracked window.
A boy is going off to school and the mother would like him to take an umbrella.
The boy tells the mother that he does not need an umbrella because it is not raining that hard.
The boy starts on his way to school.
The rain gets harder.
The boy gets all wet.
He runs home and tells the mother how sorry he is that he should have taken the umbrella.
She gives him the umbrella.
He heads off to school again.
Cinderella's father marries a wicked stepmother.
Then he passes away leaving cinderella alone with the stepmother and stepsisters.
They make her work very hard in the house serving them food and doing their chores.
The king decides to throw a big ball in honor of the son his the prince who needs to find a wife.
The wicked stepsisters are happy to be going to the ball but they do not want cinderella to attend.
So they make sure that her dress is ruined and that she cannot go to the ball.
Cinderella is lucky because the good fairy stepmother comes in and makes her a dress and gives her a coach with horses and beautiful pair of slippers and sends her off to the ball.
"She tells cinderella that she must be home by midnight or the dress will be gone , and the coach will be back turned into a pumpkin , and she will not have the pretty dress."
Cinderella goes to the ball and has a wonderful time with the prince.
At the strike of midnight she runs out because she realizes that the coach is going to turn back into a pumpkin.
As she is running she loses one of her glass slippers.
She gets home and only has the one slipper.
The prince goes all over town looking for the owner of the slipper.
He wants that girl to be his wife.
He finally gets to cinderella's house.
She tries on the slipper.
It matches the one that is missing.
They live happily ever after.
You take two slices of white bread and put them on a plate.
You take the peanut butter with a knife.
After that you take the jelly and spread the jelly on both sides on top of the peanut butter.
Then you take the bread and close the sandwich and cut a slice down the middle.
"To make a peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter, the jar of jelly, a plate, a knife, bread."
So then you would take with your knife.
I would put the peanut butter on the bread.
Then i would take and the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter.

So she ran to her room.
Got out her special gown that she would been saving for a long time.

So the prince had found the shoe.
I will only marry the girl that fits into their shoe.
So there was a proclamation sent around that the prince's footman would be going around with the shoe.
Every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe.
So the stepmother suspected that maybe cinderella was the person at the ball.
So she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket.
The mice connived and got the key out of the pocket.
Were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe.
The stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe.
But they did not make it as because their feet were much larger than cinderella's.
It looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave.
The mice had just gotten the door open to cinderella's room.
May i try on the shoe?
The footman said.
He went over to put the shoe on her.
The stepmother used her cane to trip hi am.
So the shoe fell to the ground and broke.

You can put your jelly on one piece and your peanut butter on the other.
Voila you have your peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
This looks like something that could happen in arizona where somebody goes through a wash and should not.
This lady was driving her s u v thinking she could get through the wash.
Then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along.
Then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her.
So it appears as though the he is got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot.
He is holding onto a branch that is hanging into the rushing water.
He is attempting the rescue.
No i am not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but i am assuming that is the belt for helping her.
I do not know.
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer.
So he is kicking a soccer ball down the neighborhood street and inadvertently kicks the wrong way and hits a big picture window.
The soccer ball goes through the neighbor's picture window.
The neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it.
He is got the soccer ball in his hand but he cannot seem to find who kicked it.
But i will bet ya the kid's name is on the soccer ball and he will figure it out.
Well it is time for joey to go to school.
His mom said.
You know joey i looked out the window.
Looks like it might rain today.
The weathermen said that rain could be coming today.
He said.
No ma i do not care.
I do not want to take that umbrella.
Only sissies carry umbrellas.
I am not going to take that umbrella.
I do not think it is going to rain anyway.
Well there he goes out.
What is happening but his mom was right.
It starts to rain.
First just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder.
When he comes home he is soaked to the skin.
His mother is very angry with him bebecause he did not listen to her and take the umbrella.
So the next time that this occurs and there is rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry.
That was a lesson learned.
"Cinderella's mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls, her stepmother and her stepsisters."
As time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls.
She uses her as a servant.
She has her do the cooking and the cleaning.
When the mother arrived she brought her cheshire cat along.
The cat had the rule of the house where the other animals were not treated as well.
But cinderella loved them all.
She loved the horses and the dogs and the mice.
And they all loved her.
As she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle.
"In the castle there was a wonderful prince, handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married."
The prince's servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife.
So an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball.
At that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery.
The prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time.
Well the stepmother got the invitation.
She only considered her daughters and she did not consider cinderella at all.
So she got the her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery.
Cinderella made her own dress.
With the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress.
"When she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball, that they are going to go to the ball but she is not."
So she was locked into a room.
She was visited by the fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the the ball.
So the fairy godmother with her magic bippety boppety boo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown.
Out of a pumpkin she made a carriage.
Out of the mice she made horsemen horses to carry the carriage to the palace.
But she did have a stipulation.
She said that she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear.
So she went to the ball.
She caught the eye of the prince.
The prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters.
So she danced the night away.
Then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes.
She knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the the night would disappear at that time.
So she ran from the prince.
As she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps.
She ran and she ran.
Then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night.
The pumpkin returned to its former self.
Everything returned to what they were.
When she returned home the stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace.
They would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper.
So the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it did not work.
They a mouse brought cinderella the key.
She got out of the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on.
She tried it on.
The prince then designated her as his princess.
They got married and lived happily ever after.
We have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard.
But we also have a kitty cat who loves to go up the tree.
The kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and could not get down.
So dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all.
It appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree.
He then took a ladder dad did.
But the ladder fell down.
So after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree.
There is also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree.
One afternoon the little girl's cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch.
She was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down.
Her father being the silly man that he is decided to go up and take care of the cat.
So as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch.
The ladder falls off of the tree.
At which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and which scares the cat all the more.
The cat is not going to come to the father.
But the father cannot get out of the tree anyway.
So they hafta call the fire department.
Who comes and rescues the man out of the tree.
There are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
One of ththem is to get out the bread that is already cut.
So all you hafta do is just use one.
It comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into the jar.
You can put it right on the bread.
The good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of french bread.
Slice it longways so that it is open.
You take your peanut butter.
You mix those together.
You put on the peanut butter on the sandwich.
You take the jelly.
I would not use grape jelly.
But you can use other kinds of jelly.
I i like strawberry.
Sometimes i mix the strawberry and the grape together.
I put it on there.
Then i take that sandwich.
I put it in the microwave.
I heat it so that the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together.
I still have crunchy on the top.
Then i eat that.
Cinderella's mother died when she was a young girl.
Her father remarried to a lady that had two other daughters.
So they treated cinderella very badly.
They made her clean up the house.

She says.

They say.
You cannot go.
It is impossible for you to go.
You do not have any nice clothes.
You are not going.
She was feeling pretty low.
Poof out comes her fairy godmother.
Not knowing that she even had a fairy godmother.
She says to the fairy godmother.
What in the world are you doing here?
The fairy godmother says.
She says.

Cinderella says.
She says.
I am not going to be able to to that.
She says.
I do not have a dress.
I do not have any way to get there.
She says.
It is just going to be a big drag.
The fairy godmother says.
Well i think i can make that happen.
So she takes her magic wand.
She poofs cinderella.
Cinderella looks at her.
So the godmother goes poof.
Cinderella has a great bouffant hairdo.
So cinderella says.
I yeah this is going to be pretty nice.
However i have no way to get there.
Well there was a few little mice sitting over in the corner.
They were watching all of this.
The fairy godmother goes over to them.
There is still no carriage.
Cinderella still did not want to ride on the back of the horses in this new white dress.
So the godmother says.
Well i can fix that too.
So she goes over to a pumpkin.
She goes poof and turns a pumpkin into a carriage.
Cinderella being the the person that knows a good thing when she sees it jumps into the carriage.
The godmother says.
You are going to have a great time tonight.
There is no problem.
You will you will do really good.
But you got to be home by midnight.
Cinderella says.
The godmother says.
I know i know but this everything changes at midnight.
I will hafta start all over again.
You are going to turn into a a scrub lady again at midnight if you do not get out of there.
Then we would hafta start all over again.
And you do not want to be sitting in the middle of this ball looking like a scrubber lady.
So the princess says.
Oh oh i understand.
I i know what is going on now.
So she gets to the ball.
The prince who is not taken by any girls.
He simply does not like girls.
He is looking around.
Cinderella comes in.
She changes his whole train of thought on girls.
So she bebecause quite striking.
So he says.
Well maybe i can take this one out for a night.
So he begins to dance with her.
All the other girls are kind of sitting over there by themselves.
The king he is pretty happy with himself because he thinks he is finally found a girl that the prince may be able to like.
But before they know it it is eleven fifty nine and forty five seconds.
They are still dancing.
She says.
Oh i got to get out of here or i am going to turn into a chore woman right in front of the prince.
So she says.
Prince i got to leave and i got to leave now.
He says.
Do you needta go to the bathroom or you needta?
She says.
I just got to leave.
I got to get out of of here.
So he says.
Well wait just a minute let me get your name.
She says.
That is all you need.
That is all i can tell ya.
She runs down the stairs.
As she is running down the stairs she loses her her slipper.
Which happens to be glass by the way.
Oh and so when she is running down the stairs why the slipper falls off.
Now she is wobbling down the stairs.
She jumps into her magic carriage.
Through sheer luck she makes it out of the eyes of the prince before the the final gong of twelve.
The carriage turns back into the pumpkin.
The horses turn back into mice.
She walks home about half the way because she did get out of the sight of the prince.
She walks home.
She gets home.
Probably will not hear from that guy again bebecause i can kind of tell maybe he was not all there either.
So so the prince he gets up the next morning.
He says.
I think i could go for that gal.
So and all he has is a glass slipper slipper.
So he tells all of his people.
He says.
Listen we got to find that girl.
So they go out.
They begin to look.
They check all around.
They come up to cinderella's house.
The two stepdaughters they come out and they look.
They say.
Oh i know i can get that shoe on.
If i can get that shoe on bammo i am going to be the princess.
So the prince is standing around.
He says.
He says.
You do not really look like the one i was dancing with last week but here try on the shoe.
Let us see if it works.
The first one tries it on and it is too big.
Her foot will not fit into a size ten army shoe.
The second one comes over.
She tries it.
She cannot get in it either.
The prince says.
They say.
Nope there is not anybody.
Cinderella on the other hand is looking from the kitchen where she is scrubbing the floors.
She hears this.
The prince says.
Wait a minute i just saw somebody in the kitchen.
They said.
She you do not even want to see her.
So he goes in.
He says.
Well i do not know.
She looks a little familiar.
You know if she had a good bouffant hairdo and a white dress i would probably recognize her.
So he tries on the slipper on the cinderella.
"It fits, fits like a glove."
He says.
She says.
He says.
He says.
She says.
Well my two step stepsisters and my stepmother they keep me tied up here in the kitchen.
He says.
She says.

So he he picks her up.
He takes her over to his carriage.
They go back to the castle.
The king is ecstatic bebecause she he he knows that the prince likes the girl.
And the prince and the girl they get married.
They live happily ever after.
Oh there was a flash flood that came through.
There was a little girl that was caught up in that flash flood.
She was rushed area where the flood was.
She she reached out and grabbed the tree branch.
She held onto that tree branch until a rescuer came.
The rescuer he he came acrosst.
He got to the tree branch.
He has a big belt that he is putting around her waist and her arm and her head so that he can keep her with him while they swim out of the flooded area that they are in rushing water.
A little boy was playing soccer.
He was having a great time kicking the soccer ball.

But oh in the next picture he changed his clothes.
First you take two pieces of bread.
You get out the peanut butter and a knife.
You smear the peanut butter on one side of the bread.
Then you get out the jelly and a knife.
Then you take the two pieces of bread and smack ththem together.
So the story starts with the flood.
There is lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city.
The woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went to save her cat from the flood and the rains.
So she got caught in the flood.
She got swept downstream.
She was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out.
She is been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her.
Someone saw her.
One of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on.
Okay the boy is playing soccer outside.
He kicks the ball really hard.
It goes crashing into the window.
It crashes through the window into the lamps that is next to the man sitting there.
He jumps up.
He grabs the ball.
He is looking out the window to see who kicked it.
The boy is leaving for school.
His mom is telling him to take the umbrella.
It might rain.
He says.

So she runs away from the prince.
In running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs.
She runs home.
The her dress turns back to rags.
The coach turns back to the pumpkin.
But she still has her glass slipper.
Then the next day the prince sends out someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was.
So they show up with the slipper at her house.
The stepmother locks cinderella in the room.
They try and fit the slipper on the stepsister's feet which it does not fit because they have big feet.
The mice steal the key and bring it in to cinderella so she can escape her room.

Cinderella's father marries her stepmother.

Cinderella becomes their slave.
She does all the housework.

Cinderella looks in her trunk and is looking for dress to wear.
Her stepsisters are get dressed.
She goes down to join them.
They say.

"So she goes back to her room, is really upset, and the stepmother and stepsisters go off to the ball."
Then there is a fairy godmother.
She makes a wish to be able to go to the ball.
The fairy godmother creates a carriage and a horse and a beautiful dress to take her to the ball.
She goes to the ball in a beautiful dress and shoes and.
The only thing is she hasta be back by midnight because everything will turn back to its original material.
So the dog and the horse will will go back to their original things.

Okay once upon a time there was a girl traveling down a road.
It was raining very hard.
But she hadta get home.
So she crossed the bridge.
But the bridge was not very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was decaying the under girders.
So the bridge gave way.
The girl fell off of the bridge.
For she was really riding a bike.
She fell into the water.
She found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help.
Eventually someone heard her cries for help.
She asked the man if there was anything she could do for him.
He said.
Do not ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain.
He decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball.
He kicked it into the air.
It crashed through a neighbor's window.
The neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window.
He picked up the ball and looked out the window.
But the boy ran away.
The man walked outside looking for the boy.
When the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball.
The man scolded him.
Made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge.
Then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even.
One day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain.
The boy said.
But thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella.
Then the boy was walking to school.
It started to rain.
The boy was disappointed that maybe he did not have control over everything like he thought he did.
So he ran back home as the rain got harder splashing in the puddles.
Wetly came in the door saying nothing.
So she gave it to him.
He walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mother's love.
Once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella.
I would guess.
There was a little girl.
Her father was widowed.
So he remarried.
The new stepmother had two daughters the girl's age.
As the dad got out of the picture by an unfortunate series of events the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave.
Which is why she is actually called cinderella so i do not know what her name was before.
One day a message came from the castle.
Said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife.
The wicked stepmother was not interested in letting cinderella go.
So when cinderella came downstairs she instigated a jealousy war with her daughters.
Did i mention that mice and birds made her dress?
She did not do that at all.
They had taken things from the sisters.
So the sisters ripped their belongings off of cinderella's dress.
But the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle.
As cinderella cried in the garden.
Her rather plump fairy godmother came.
Cinderella went to the castle.
The prince fell madly and instantly in love with her.
As the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight the magic would wear off.
So when the crock clock struck twelve she ran down the stairs.
Leaving one of her beautiful glass slippers on the stairs which one of the ambassador types found.
So all the people in the castle decided that cinderella was it.
Even though the prince had spent couple hours with her.
Went looking for her using the glass slipper.
When the people came to the door of cinderella's abode.
The stepmother had because she did not want them to find her.
Mice once again came to her rescue giving her the key.
She raced downstairs.
The shoe fit perfectly.
They found cinderella.
Cinderella went to the palace.
They lived happily ever after.
She had her dog.
No she had a cat.
She and the cat were playing.
The a dog came by and chased the cat up the tree.
The little girl could not reach the cat.
So she called her dad.
Her dad came with a ladder.
But the ladder fell.
The dog continued to bark.
The dad was stuck.
The cat contentedly sat at the end of the branch.
The little girl still could not reach the cat.
So she called the fireman to come save the dad and the cat.
They brought their ladder.
Well i guess i can back up and say that the girl rode her bike to the place where she played with her cat.
There was a bird singing happily in all the cacophony.
Suddenly they took a wrong turn.
The water got very abrupt.
The little girl fell out of of the boat.
She knew how to swim but she got caught under a tide and luckily was going near a branch.
One of the state rescuers quickly jumped in the water to to get her out and told her to hold onto the branch and he would rescue her with the safety belt.
He is practicing for the state championship.
He likes to practice kicking the ball up in the air.
He accidentally kicked the ball into his neighbor's window.
"It crashed through, hitting mister phillips while he was watching tv."
Mister phillips angrily grabbed the soccer ball and looked outside to see where robert was.
He was going to go tell him to not kick the ball anymore near his house.
Every morning mommy gets billy ready for school.
Today she told billy that she heard on the news that it was going to rain outside.
Billy said.
I do not want to use an umbrella today.
I am just going to go ahead and walk to school.
Billy then on his way to school realizes that it is pouring down rain.
Later he comes back.
He is soaking wet.
Mommy is frustrated because his clothes are wet and his hair is wet and his book bag is wet.
She said.
I told you it was going to rain.
Billy then takes the umbrella and walks to school so that he is dry for the next day.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella who was brought to live in the palace where two stepsisters were and an evil stepmother.
She was brought there because she was going to be their helper and clean their house and make them dinner.
She would live there for the rest of her life.
"They actually picked at her, made fun of her."
As she grew up a she always wondered as she looked out the window what it would be like to live in the palace.
Soon as she got older she she saw that there was an invitation to the grand ball to meet the prince.
The stepsisters were all getting ready to go as well.
The evil stepmother was was making sure that they were going to be greeted by the prince and have an invitation of their very own to meet him in person.
Cinderella thought.
I wonder how i would get to the ball.
So she opened up a chest and there she saw a beautiful pink gown that all the little mice that lived with her in the house decided that they were going to help sew the dress back together and make it a beautiful dress for her to wear to the palace.
Soon the stepsisters found out that cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the prince as well.
They came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress.
Cinderella thought.
Now what shall i do?
How will i ever get to meet the prince and get away from my evil stepsisters?
Then out of nowhere a beautiful good witch showed up.
She granted cinderella a wish.
The wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city.
That nothing would ever compare.
She would also grant her a a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince.
The only exception was that she would hafta be back by midnight or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin.
Cinderella said.
Yes i hafta go.
Then i shall grant you your wish.
There she was standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine.
Off she went to the palace.
There everyone stood in line to meet the prince.
Finally cinderella got her turn.
She said.
I can not finish my dance with the prince.
So she hurrily ran down the stairs.
As she ran down the stairs one of her glass slippers fell off.
The prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown.
Minutes later cinderella turned back to her maid outfit in her rags and no riches anymore were on her.
She went back to scrubbing the floors mopping wondering about her wish to become a princess one day.
Then soon there was a knock at the door.
He was wondering where which person the slipper belonged to of all the stepsisters.
The stepsisters lined up and tried to squeeze their foot into the shoe but to their dismize the shoe did not fit.
Finally cinderella noticed that they were all trying to figure out where which foot would fit in the glass slipper.
Then she put her foot in.
The prince knew that this was the wonderful girl that he had met all along.
He decided to make her the princess.
They lived happily ever after.
Early sunday morning jenny's cat climbed up the tree.
She could not get the cat down.
The dog chester was barking.
Daddy decided to climb up and try to get the the cat out of the tree.
The ladder fell down.
He as well could not get down.
So the firemen decided to come and rescue both of them.
You take two pieces of bread.
You take a knife and you spread the peanut butter on the bread.
Then you open the jar of jelly.
You spread it.
Then you put the two pieces of bread together.
There was a flash flood in somewhere down south.
A little girl got swept away.
One of the very muscular emergency workers crawled out on a limb.
It looks like he has some kind of bag over his shoulder.
She finds her family and everything's okay.
There is a boy outside practicing soccer.
Oops kicks the soccer ball through the front window of a neighbor's house.
The neighbor grabs the ball and looks out the window to see who did it.
But do i needta go on or is that it?
In the morning a little boy's getting ready for school.
Mother says.
I do not want the umbrella.
As he walks to school he gets stuck in the rain.
It is coming down harder and harder.
He asks to go back home.
She gives him the umbrella that he should have taken it in the first place.
Then he walks happily back towards school.
She had a very generous dad.
The dad remarried and had a stepmother who had two children anastasia and druzella.
The dad passed away.
When he died the stepmother turned cinderella into kind of a housemaid and used all the resources to give her two children fancy dresses and voice lessons and all the nicer things in life while cinderella scrubbed the floors cleaned the fireplace.
But cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life.
She became friends with all the animals in the house except lucifer.
But she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends.
She lived upstairs in the attic and always dreamed of the castle she could see from her window.
I think it was prince philip.
Prince philip's father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife.
So he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens so that the prince could meet all the girls in the village.
The invitations get sent out.
The stepmother opens the invitation and says.
Oh it is going to be a grand ball.
All the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince.
Cinderella overhears her telling the story to stepsisters.
She says.
Oh i want to go.
Stepmother says.
Of course you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done.
So she makes up a bunch of chores for cinderella to do.
She says.
Cinderella says.
Well i washed the floor yesterday.
She says.
She had her do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball.
As she is helping her sisters get ready she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons.
When they are done she goes upstairs to the attic and finds a dress a in an old trunk that useta be her mother's.
She shows the mice her beautiful dress.
Shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away.
But the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready.
So while she is away the mice help make the dress pretty.
Jasper and gus decide to go out and get some more pretty things to add to the dress.
They grab a a pearl necklace that that jasper drops.
The pearls go flying on the place.
Both mice pick up all the pearls.
"Lucifer's watching ththem, the cat."
They manage just to get the beads stuck on jasper's tail and slide under the door.
The birds help.
The mice help.
They get the dress made up real pretty.
They sing a song.
They get the dress made.
Cinderella comes in the attic.
They surprise her with this beautiful dress.
She is so happy she can go to the ball.
So she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and the her stepsisters to wait bebecause she can go to the ball now bebecause she has something to wear and she is finished all her chores.
The stepsisters see how beautiful she looks and her beautiful dress.
They see that the decorations are stuff that she quote unquote stole from their garbage.
So they start ripping their beads and their sashes back bebecause they want them back.
They leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball.
She starts crying bebecause she wanted to go to the ball.
"This fairy godmother appears and does this bippety boppety boo thing, whips her up a real pretty white dress."
Then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses.
She tells cinderella go dance with the prince but she hasta be back by midnight or the spell will wear off.
So cinderella goes to the ball.
She meets the prince.
Everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with.
She hears the clock strike midnight.
She hasta go.
I do not even know your name.
She goes running down the stairs to catch her coach which was starting to be a pumpkin.
As she is running down the stairs one of her shoes falls off.
She gets in the coach.
The coach takes her home.
She arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
The horses turn back into the mice.
Dog footman turns back into a dog.
The next day she is walking around in the house.
She hears the the duke come to the door and says.
The prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride but he does not know who she is.
So he is going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that this maiden's left behind.
So he ends up going to cinderella's house.
She hears the duke coming to the door.
She goes to her room.
"The stepmother locks her in her room, puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the duke into the house."
The duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small.
As the mother is sitting there the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rescue cinderella.
Again they run into the cat.
But they escape the cat again.
They go underneath the door.
They hand the key to cinderella.
She unlocks the door.
As she is leaving the duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister.
As he is leaving cinderella runs down the stairs and says.
I i want to try this shoe on.
The stepmother pretty much has a good idea that cinderella's the one the prince was dancing with.
So as the duke is walking over with the glass slipper on a pillow to go give it to cinderella the stepmother trips him.
He falls.
The glass slipper breaks into a million pieces.
Cinderella says.
She pulls the other glass slipper out of her pocket and says.
I have the other one.
So she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after in the palace.
Let us see.
Let us see fido the dog was chasing fluffy the kitty.
Chased fluffy the kitty up a tree.
Fluffy's owner a little girl's riding her bike.
She sees fluffy up a tree.
She calls to him.
But he will not come down.
So she runs to the house and gets her dad.
Dad gets a ladder.
But the dog knocks the ladder out of the way.
So a neighbor hears what is going and calls the fire department.
They come out to save the dad and fluffy.
There is a bird singing.
A little girl was playing outside in the yard with her kitty and her puppy.
Suddenly she realized her kitty had gone up into the tree and was lounging on the branch.
The birds were singing.
She would been riding her tricycle also.
She went and got her dad.
Her dad came out.
But he got scared.
Could not the kitty was on a branch he could not reach.
So he was sitting there and did not know how to get back down.
The dog was barking at the dad.
Someone mommy probably realized what was going on.
She called the fire department.
The fire department came with a ladder.
Actually it looks like a ladder laying there.
So dad probably climbed up on the ladder.
Then the ladder fell down.
He could not get back down.
Okay you get two pieces of bread.
You get your peanut butter and your jelly.
First you put the peanut butter on one slice of bread.
Then you put the jelly on the other slice of bread.
Then you place the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and jelly touching each other.
Then you slice it in half.
There was a family that was going home.
There was some water in the road where they were going to cross.
The father decided to go ahead.
That they could make it.
But as they got about half way across the water was too deep.
They were all getting crawling out the window.
Some people they had called nineoneone.
There was a first responder that came.
Was reaching out to save the little girl that was in the churning water that had gone under but then had come back up.
There was a young man that was learning to play soccer.
He was practicing with his kicks in the front yard.
He kicked it really good.
Only thing he kicked it too hard.
Was not careful about where he was aiming.
It hit the window.
He had kicked it so hard that it broke the window.
His dad was sitting inside when the soccer ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp.
He jumped up and grabbed the soccer ball.
Saw that it was his son that was practicing.
So he understood.
Knew that it was just a window and it could be repaired.
The little boy was getting ready ta go to school.
He had his backpack on.
Mom told him.
It looks like and i had read in the paper that it is going to rain today.
He told her.
I do not need an umbrella today.
It looks beautiful outside.
So he went.
But he started walking and was on his way ta school.
Suddenly it started sprinkling.
He was getting wet.
He went running back through the puddles and through the rain back to the house.
Mom looked at him and said.
I told you so.
So he got the umbrella.
Then he was walking to school with the umbrella even though he was already wet.
Cinderella and her father lived in a lovely home with her dog.
Father brings home the stepmother and two stepdaughters.
Then very quickly the stepmother and the stepdaughters become mean.
They start being mean to cinderella and ordering her around.
Making her take care of them and do everything for them.
Cinderella feels sad.
But she has her the little animals around the house.
That keeps her happy.
Then the the king where they live tells the prince that he needs to get married.
It is time for him to marry.
They are going to have a big ball to invite all of the people in the kingdom for him to choose his bride.
They laugh and tell cinderella she cannot go.
I think a a room.
She finds a trunk with a beautiful dress in it.
But then they come in.
They they rip it and laugh at her.
They rip it apart.
Well they go to the ball.
Her animal friends and the fairy godmother comes.
They help her.
The fairy godmother uses her wand.
The little mice and all the animals they turn into a coach and white horses to pull the coach.
She has on glass slippers.
The fairy godmother tells her to have a good time.
The only thing is she needed to be back by midnight.
Not to be later because everything would return as it was.
So cinderella goes.
The prince falls in love with her.
They dance.
He thinks she is beautiful.
They have a good time.
Cinderella suddenly realizes the clock is saying that it is twelve of the clock.
So she hurries down the stairs.
She remembers how beautiful everything was and what a good time she had.
Then the next day the groomsman of the prince comes around with the glass slipper to find who it fits.
It fits cinderella.
So they live happily ever after.
You bring out the bread and the peanut butter and the jelly.
You get a butter knife.
You open the bag of bread.
You bring out the bread.
You put two slices down.
I would say this lady was somehow caught in a flash flood.
She held onto a tree for dear life as the water was rushing by her.
A rescuer who suited up in his gear somehow got acrossed to her.
Alright little boy was outside playing and having a good time when he was kicking his soccer ball.
His soccer ball went through his front window.
Dad was sitting down and watching t v at the time when the soccer ball coming through the window startled him.
He picked up the ball and walked towards the window and yelled something out towards me.
Early one school morning a little boy and his mom were getting ready to go.
Mom handed the little the umbrella to the little boy.
He said.
Mom i do not need the umbrella.
I am going to be fine.
He turned and he left outside the door.
As he was walking to school it started to rain.
It started to rain even harder and harder and puddles were forming.
So he ran home.
He changed his clothes.
Alright when cinderella was a young girl her father remarried.
Soon after he remarried her her father died.
Her wicked stepmother made her do all the cooking and the cleaning.
She became the maid.
She was forced to sleep outside with the animals.
Okay what happens next?
As she is cleaning she looks outside the window.
She looks at the castle wondering one day when her prince is going to come.
Inside the castle the king was talking to his first in command about how his son needed to get married.
It was time for him to start taking over the throne.
So the king decides to announce that there is going to be a ball where the prince is going to be able to meet all the eligible young girls in the kingdom.
Cinderella is told if all of her chores are done then she can go to the ball.
But she has nothing to wear.
So she goes upstairs.
She realizes that she has an old chest old dress and some other things.
Because she has so many chores not able to actually fix up her dress.
So while she is working the animals that she has befriended make the dress for her.
As she is getting ready her her stepsisters see that she is coming downstairs looking very pretty so they all rip up her dress.
Then they take off.
As she is crying her fairy godmother comes and turns the pumpkin into a coach.
When she arrives at the ball the prince decides he wants to dance with her and falls madly in love with her.
But she hasta remember that the her fairy godtmother told her that she hasta be home by the stroke of midnight because that is when the spell will will disappear.
So as she is dancing she her she hears the bells ring.
So she takes off running.
She loses one of her glass slippers.
The prince wants to know her name and she is she never tells the prince anything.
Running while she is driving home in the coach the the clock strikes finally twelve.
Everybody turns back into a pumpkin.
She turns back into cinderella with her torn clothes.
But she has the one glass slipper.
Then the prince and the king decide that they want to find the girl with the glass slipper.
They go around.
Everybody who they can possibly find.
The wicked stepmother she locked cinderella into a closet.
Prince's prince's assistant comes and asks to see if there is any girls in the house besides the stepsisters she says.
But cinderella the animals give cinderella a key and she comes downstairs.
As the man goes to walk for and put this shoe on cinderella.
The wicked stepmother trips him.
However she has her other glass slipper.
So she puts on the glass slipper.
They realize that she is definitely the one that the prince fell in love with.
The they get married and live happily ever after.
I put smear the peanut butter on one slice of the bread.
Then i take jelly.
Then i pick one one slice up.
This woman was walking.
All of a sudden a flash flood came up and swept her down stream.
"A rescue worker came along looking to see if there are any victims in the flood, saw her out there begging for help."
He climbs out on a long branch to rescue her.
Brings a belt with a rope attached to it that pull her back to shore safely.
Boy she looks cold.
Little boy is getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella.
He says.
I do not need an umbrella.
It is not raining.
Once again she asks him.
He walks out the door and starts walking to school when all of a sudden it starts to rain.
It starts raining harder and harder.
"He turns around, runs back and runs into the house."
He is soaking wet.
His hair's plastered down.
His shirt is soaked.
His mom looks at him and says.
Now did not i ask you if you needed that umbrella?
So he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school again.
There is a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can.
In fact it sails so far it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room.
When it comes through the glass after breaking a window it even knocks over a lamp in the living room.
"The man who is sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through jumps up, grabs the ball and looks out the window."
But the boy's run away.
There once was a young girl called cinderella.
She had three ugly stepsisters.
Her family did not like her very much and made her do all the household chores.
She hadta scrub.
She hadta cook and sew and everything all by herself while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun.
One day the prince was going to have a big ball.
All three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear.
"Looking around, buying new dresses, checking out how they looked."
But cinderella could not go.
When all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and says.
Cinderella says.
I cannot go to the ball that the prince is having but my stepsisters get to go instead.
The fairy godmother says.
She waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears.
She says.
Well you are going to need horses and a coach to ride.
So she snatches up some mice that were playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage.
She a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball.
But the fairy godmother says.
At the stroke of midnight all of this will disappear.
So cinderella goes to the ball.
She has a wonderful time.
She is dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince.
He just wants to dance with her all night.
When she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it is five minutes to midnight.
So she turns and races out of the ball.
In a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers.
As they race away but right at the stroke of midnight the horses change back into mice.
Her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen.
She sneaks into the house.
All her stepsisters were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady.
He tries to find her.
All he hasta go by is the one glass slipper that she lost behind her.
He goes around.
He tries every girl is town to see whose foot the slipper will fit on.
The three stepsisters all try to squeeze their feet into that glass slipper as hard as they can.
But they cannot make ththem fit.
When the prince looks over at the what he thinks is just the maid and says.
Why do not you try it on?
Well would not you know he tries it on her and it fits perfectly.
They lived happily ever after.
There was a cat that was walking outside when all of a sudden a dog came along and chased the cat right up a tree.
A little girl on her tricycle saw that her cat was up the tree.
Started crying that her cat would not come back down.
Dad came out to see what all the commotion was about.
Saw that he could get the cat back down by grabbing a ladder from his garage and climbing up the tree to get the cat.
Unfortunately once he got up the tree the ladder fell down.
Now dad was trapped up the tree with the cat while the dog was still barking.
Somebody called the fire department.
They came over to rescue the cat and dad from the tree.
The firemen had a great laugh about that when they got back to the firehouse.
Okay you need a loaf of bread a jar of peanut butter some jelly and a knife.
You get out two slices of bread.
You have a sandwich.
It had been raining for days and days.
Everyone knew the river was rising.
Residents in the area were warned to leave town.
To find shelter elsewhere elsewhere until the river river waters went down.
One family the jones would not leave.
They would seen the river ride for many many many years.
Never felt like they were threatened.
Well this day the river rose up.
They decide to move upstairs.
The water was still rising.
The rain was still coming down.
It was becoming nighttime.
They moved up to the top of their house where they were able to sit on the roof.
Mister and missus jones looked around.
They did not see their daughter.
Their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddy bear.
The water had already risen that high.
So she had been swept away by the river.
The parents suddenly realized.
They heard a yelling and a screaming.
They looked from the rooftop.
They saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river.
Luckily with our technology the jones had a cellphone.
They dialed nineoneone and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid.
They threw out a line across the river.
He climbed out clinging to the rope.
He reached down.
She grabbed ahold of his arm.
He wrapped a device around her waist to secure her body to his.
But they learned a lesson.
Next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home.
He did it what he loves most was was to play soccer.
He took his ball out.
The neighbor is taken by surprise when the ball comes sailing in.
Lands on his lap as he is relaxing on the couch.
He picks up the ball.
Who could have kicked that ball?
He could not see anyone.
I am going to call his parents immediately.
First i am going to pick up the glass off this couch.
Get it cleaned up.
Then i will call them.
Find out what is going on.
He calls the neighbors.
Mister smith picks up the phone.
The man says.
Is your son missing his soccer ball because i see some initials here.
Mister smith says.
What happened?
Did you find his ball?
Yes i found it in my living room.
It came right through my glass.
Mister smith said.
I will take care of it.
He calls his son.
James rob are you missing your soccer ball?
James said.
If i am missing one i would not really notice it.
His dad says.
Well our neighbor found one on his lap.
It had sailed through his window.
He is livid because it broke his window.
But i did not do not remember it going through anybody's window.
He said.
Well that is a shame because they your initials are marked on the ball in the sharpie.
Remember i reminded you to do that so you would not lose them.
What should we do.
He said.
Well the first thing you needta do is to get some money from your piggy bank.
Then i think that you better apologize.
That is what i will do.
He said.
Well you have learned a lesson.
We will take care of it.
So that evening excuse me they went over to the neighbor's house.
James rob brought his piggybank.
He said he was willing to pay for the broken window.
Neighbor said.
Insurance covers it.
I know it was an accident.
I appreciate your honesty and your integrity for coming forth.
I would really like to come see.
You have got quite a kick.
So all ended well for the family and the neighbor.
Jim take your umbrella.
It is going to rain today for sure.
No mom i am not going to take it.
Jim decides to take off.
He walks to school.
The rain got harder and harder.
So jim runs right back home.
His mother is displeased because now he is going to be late for school.
He is soaking wet.
I am not driving you to school.
You are still going to hafta walk.
You explain to the principal why you are late.
So james takes his umbrella.
Ready to face the consequences of not listening to the good advice of his mother.
There was a young woman and her father.
They lived in a town all alone.
Her mother had died.
One day he met another woman.
The woman had two daughters.
It looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created.
Well sadly the father died.
She did not see cinderella as her own.
So she made her more of a house servant than a daughter.
She made her wait on her her two daughters.
But she felt like that was her destiny.
So she cleaned and cooked and did everything that she was told to do.
Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart.
She made friends with the animals.
She never had time to go out and do anything with other friends.
Cinderella's gentle heart would carry her a long way.
Let us see.
Let us back up a little bit.
I are not thinking about the pictures in the book.
The town was ruled by a king.
The this king had a son.
If he was not married he could not become king.
So the the the king decided to throw a ball inviting all eligible young women.
So he would have a large large number to pick from for his future bride.
The invitations were delivered.
Certainly the stepsisters were invited.
In fact every young eligible woman was invited.
Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation.
But the stepmother was not about to let her go.
So she was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses.
Prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives.
So off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball.
Cinderella stayed at home very sad very lonely.
When suddenly some magical event appeared occurred.
Her fairy godmother appeared.
You can go to the ball.
The stepmother instantly created a dress for her.
But one warning she was given was.
If you do not return before midnight everything all the magic wears off.
Your dress will become rags again.
Your carriage will become a pumpkin again.
She said.
So she goes to the ball.
Has a wonderful time dancing with the prince.
He is entirely taken with her.
Noone knows who she is because she is never been dressed this way.
The stepsisters did not even recognize her.
Well it is getting close to midnight.
Cinderella knows she must say goodbye.
The clock starts to strike.
She flees.
She tells the prince she hasta leave she hasta leave.
She takes off.
As she is running away her clothes begin to change.
Yet one of her glash glass slippers is left behind on the stairwell.
She gets back to her house.
Finds that she still has one of the glass slippers left.
But she had a wonderful time.
So magical she can hardly believe it happened.
Well the next day the king realized that his son said.
I do not know who this young maiden is.
I will i do not know her from our town.
I have got to be able to find her.
Sent out couriers to find out where this princess must live.
She must live in the community.
The only way they will know if she is the one is if the remaining glass slipper that was left on the stairwell would fit her.
So the the prince's men take the slipper and visit from house to house in the town.
They come upon cinderella's home.
Yet the stepmother in no way is going to allow cinderella to try on the slipper.
Only she only wants her two stepdaughters.
Because she wants one of them to marry the prince.
Well both stepdaughters try on the the shoe.
Of course they are trying to force it.
But it does not fit them.
They try on the the slipper.
Of course it fits.
So the prince finds his princess.
They live happily ever after.
Suddenly they hear a meowing.
They run outside.
They see the cat is stuck within the tree.
Well dad says.
I can take care of that.
I have got a ladder.
He runs to the garage.
Next thing you know misty their dog runs up with all the excitement.
Somebody please call nineoneone.
So the little girl runs to the house.
Next thing you hear is an ambulance siren.
The firemen pull up.
Yes the cat in the meantime had crawled down the tree.
Little girl's riding her tricycle.
Her cat got caught up the tree.
Dad came to save the the cat.
But the ladder fell down.
So the dog starts barking.
Pretty soon the firemen came to get the cat and the dad down.
You take two slices of bread from the refrigerator.
Make sure you have your jelly out.
First you start with the peanut butter.
I do mine in the middle.
Ya slap it on one side.
Then with the other slice of bread you get all that extra peanut butter off.
Then ya dive into the jelly.
You put it on the other one.
Then you put ththem together and enjoy.
There is a man and a woman.
It looks as if the man is hanging on to a branch to rescue this young lady that is caught in the snow.
Alright there is a little boy playing soccer.
He is practicing.
He practices his kicks.
The ball goes right into a window.
Knocks over a lamp that is sitting on a table next to a man sitting in a chair.
The man stands up holding the soccer ball and looks out the broken window.
A little boy is leaving the house with his backpack.
His mother is going to give him an umbrella.
But he declines the umbrella.
Starts to rain.
Now it is really raining.
He comes home.
Mother is looking very cross at her very wet son.
He gets the umbrella.
Cinderella lived with her father and her dog.
One day he brings home a new wife and her two daughters.
Now the father hasta go away and leave the stepmother in charge.
The stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry.
They get a notice because the prince hasta get married.
He must find a wife.
So they are going to have a ball so that he can pick out a wife.
Cinderella says.
Oh may i go too?
Well if you get all of your chores done.
Then help your sisters get ready.
Then if you have any time you can go with us.
So they give her all kinds of work to do.
In meantime her little friends the mice help with getting her dress ready.
Now the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they do not want.
So they take ththem and make her dress.
She has this pretty little dress.
The evil stepsisters take the the necklace and the ribbon and they just rip it right off of her dress.
Off they go to the ball.
When her fairy godmother comes.
Well you get to go to ball.
She puts her in this very pretty dress by magic.
She looks very nice.
She dances with prince charming.
They have a wonderful time.
But she hasta be at back by midnight.
So when the clock strikes twelve.
She runs down the stairs but she loses a slipper.
She gets home just in time.
But she hasta walk because the the carriage turned back into a pumpkin.
The the horses turned back into mice.
The footman turned back into a dog.
So then the i guess the the duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in this shoe.
So they get to cinderella's house.
The evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom so that she cannot try it on just in case.
The oldest stepdaughter stepsister tries on the shoe and it is too small.
So they put it on the other stepsister and it is too small.
We do not know what we are going to to do.
In the meantime the mice get the key from the stepmother.
Cinderella comes downstairs.
May i try?
So she tries on the slipper.
Of course it fits.
She marries prince charming.
They live happily ever after.
You make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking two pieces of bread.
You on one side you spread the peanut butter.
On the other side you spread the jelly.
Then you put the two together.
People were doing such foolish things.
But in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people.
We have a firefighter that jumped in the water to save a little girl who was about to drown.
He held onto her until other help could get there to help get her out ofthe the swirling water.
Surely she would have died if he had not been there to help her out.
He would been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well.
So he gave it a boot one time.
He actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it.
Fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair.
When it fell on his lap he was startled.
Got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from.
But of course the little boy had run away.
Mother had heard the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day.
So when i was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella.
I said.
Oh mom it is not going to rain today.
I have my backpack.
If anything happens i can hold it over my head.
I will not get as wet.
So i am not going to take the umbrella.
I no sooner got down the road then would not you know lo and behold it started to rain.
The rain turned into a torrent.
I was actually getting very soak soaked from head to toe.
I got back to the house.
My mom looked at me and did not say a word.
But she knew.
After changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack i headed out again on my way to school.
This time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain.
She had an aunt but her aunt was a very bitter person.
So she and her daughters were living in the house.
But cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid.
She hadta keep the house cleaned up no matter what.
As she grew older she grew more and more beautiful.
The other girls grew up.
In the meantime the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married.
To do that he wanted ta have a great ball.
He sent out invitations to all the the influential people within the land that they would could attend the ball.
Cinderella's mother had gotten the invitation.
Cinderella said.
Well can i also go?
Her mother said.
So while she was doing that she was became a little bit disconcerted.
Her all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball.
Because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her.
She asked what she really wanted.
She told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball.
So her fairy godmother waved her wand.
Gave her the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear.
To take her off to the ball she hadta have a coach.
So she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin.
She turned the pumpkin into the coach.
They get to the ball.
Cinderella meets the prince.
She has a dance with the prince.
The prince does not want to see anyone else.
He is enjoying himself so much.
So as this clock was striking the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince.
On her way out she lost one of her glass slippers.
She got to her coach.
It immediately turned back into a pumpkin.
The animals turned back into the mice and the cat.
She made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again.
He had kept the the glass slipper.
Knew that he hadta see her again.
So he sent out a decree to look for the young woman whose who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper.
That that would be the only way that he would know that it was her.
All of the young women decided to go and try the slipper but none of ththem could make it fit.
The prince announced that he this was the woman that he would marry.
They all lived happily ever after.
Little girl's cat started chasing after the bird.
Well somewhere along the line the commotion was recognized by the neighbor's dog.
The neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree.
The little girl called for her father.
He came over with a ladder.
Well the ladder fell so now he was trapped in the tree.
The little girl was hoping the cat would come down.
The neighbor seeing all this had called the fire department and who showed up with another ladder to try and help the man and the cat down off the tree.
They all lived happily ever after.

In this particular situation they are playing soccer.
The boy kicks the soccer ball.
Sometimes the ball does not go where he wants it to go.

It is not going to rain.
He waves goodbye to his mother.
It starts to rain.
It starts coming down harder.
He heads turns around and heads back home.
He is soaking wet.

Or for one reason or another they are separated from their spouse or their spouses died.
They each have children.
The man has one child and and she is a girl.
The woman has two children and they are both girls.

She can see the outer window of the the the castle.
It is the they live not far from the castle and and she can see the castle and so forth.
One day the an invitation comes for the family to go to this ball castle.
In the mother's own way she berates cinderella and says she is not qualified or not beautiful enough to go.
She hasta stay home while her two daughters and her husband goes.
She is touched by a fairy godmother.
Everybody leaves to the ball.
While they are at the ball she is touched by the fairy godmother.
She transforms this beautiful girl into a queen.
She gives her glass slippers to wear and just everything.
So she goes to the ball.
And prince charming the prince at the ball was dancing with a lot of women.
Suddenly cinderella comes in and every all the lights and all all the attention shot cues on cinderella.
She gets get.
The one condition that the the fairy godmother gave her.
I forgot to mention this.
The one condition the fairy gothuhmother gave her on going to the ball was that at the strike of twelve be home at midnight bebecause she would turn into a pumpkin so to speak.
She has a great time.
And suddenly she is dancing with the prince.
He is enamored with her.

But she keeps her her glass slipper.
So prince charming found the grass glass slipper wants to know whose foot that would fit on.
So he goes around to all the people in the kingdom at the ball.
The glass slipper does not fit anybody.
He goes to the house where they are at.
And they find that they are the mother knows he coming.
So they lock cinderella up so the prince does not see her.
And he comes with a glass slipper to try to fit it girl.
"And cinderella the friends of cinderella, the animal friends bring her the key to get out of the room she is locked in."
She gets out of the room and and goes out to the room where they are all checking it.
The mother gets all upset that she is there and throw things.
And the person who is who is doing the work for the prince the the.
What do you call it?
I guess they would use that word.
His footman says.
Well let me try it.
Each you found out the glass slipper did not fit on the other two girls.
Let me try to put the slipper on on cinderella.
He does.
It fits.
The fantasy comes back.
She becomes the missus princess.
She becomes the princess king or prince.
This picture is centered around the fact that the family cat went up to the tree.
Dad wanted to get the cat down from the tree.
So he gets the ladder.
Goes starts goes up in the tree after the cat.
Lo and behold the family dog is comes out.
He knocks the ladder down.
She has her bike.
She is yelling for the cat to come down.
Dad is stuck in the tree.
The cat is stuck in the tree.
Mom went and called the fire department.
They arrived with their truck and their ladder.
They are going to end up going in the tree saving saving dad giving and probably bringing the cat down.
It looked like this little girl was out riding a bicycle.
She happened to look up and see a cat in the tree.
Now the cat might have been up at the tree because he saw a bird in the tree.
But that is what hafta be happening.
I guess the father came by with a short ladder and tried to help.
He got up in the tree.
The ladder fell over.
He was stuck there.
The little dog who happened to be out walking with the father at the time is at the tree barking to help his father.
The two firemen came to the scene.
They have a better ladder.
They are going to go up and rescue the cat.
The little girl can then go on and continue her bicycle ride.
He can continue his walk with the dog.
It looks like the river as was frequent at this time of the year has risen above its banks.
In one section this little girl got trapped.
She was probably with her mommy or her daddy in the car or with a friend playing on the banks and fell in.
She managed to hang onto a little thicket.
While she hung onto that branch people had noticed her.
They called the fireman.
Now the fireman with great great courage went out into the water to save the young girl.
As you can see it is looped over here.
The harness that will go on her with her safety jacket.
Then they pulled both the fireman and the young girl to safety.
Bam there it goes.
It not only breaks the window.
It also knocks over the lamp.
But they pick up the ball.
He says.
I am going out and straighten this mess out.
Momma says.
It looks like its going to rain.
He says.
He says.
I do not need the umbrella.
Then when as he gets out the front door and into the street it is coming down.
He says.
He says.
I will try a little further on.
I i i do not want to say i was wrong.
But then it got so bad he hadta run home.
When he goes home he is soaking wet.
Mom says.
See i told you to take that umbrella.
He does not have anything to say.
He is just feeling like.
Oh it just happened.
But he took the umbrella from mom this time.
Well the story starts with cinderella being into with her father there.
I guess the mean old aunt came in.
They just looking at her as a downgrade.
Eventually while the father's away the aunt's running the house.
Cinderella then becomes a servant.
She hasta cater to them feed them clean the house wash their things.
She is treated just as a lowlife servant.
She cannot do nothing about it because daddy's gone.
There is nothing we can do about that.
Then all of a sudden the aunt gets an invitation to the great ball.
You hafta have this ball.
You should find your princess that we are looking forward to all your life.
You get to be an old man.
He sent out invitations to all eligible ladies to attend the ball.
So they sent out the invitations.
The aunt read the invitation.
Here is cinderella thinking that she is going to the ball.
She found this old dress and laid it out.
All of the friends that she got to know being in the house the mices and the meeses and the other things running around.
They all got together.
They fixed the dress up adorable.
They sewed hems and everything else on it.
The princess tried it on.
She looked beautiful.
But then the aunt and the two cousins come in.
The stepdaughters they were going.
They took the jewelery.
They took the dress.
They says.
You are not going to the ball.
We are going to the ball.
They got dressed up.
She helped ththem get dressed.
They went to the ball.
Then cinderella is sitting there crying and upset.
Then all of a sudden the fairy godmother appears.
Cinderella you are going to go to the ball.
She touches her magic wand.
Then cinderella's beautiful in her white dress flowing wonderful.
As they are walking out the door.
She says.
But how can i get there?
She touches the pumpkin.
Then all of a sudden all these great steeds pure white horses with gold reins and everything else and this carriage appears.
She says.
She says.
But there is one caveat.
She says.
As if you are not home by midnight all this will vanish.
She says.
When she went to the ball and the prince saw her he was so taken with her that he spent the whole night dancing with her and having such a wonderful time.
They are squawking and everything else like that.
Being that she is having a wonderful time.
She forgot to notice the thing.
Then all of a sudden the clock strikes twelve.
The first tick goes off.
She says.
Oh i must go.
The prince says.
No stay stay.
We are still going a lot before us.
She says.
No i must go.
She runs down this great staircase of red velvet carpet.
But she lost one of her slippers one of the glass slippers.
She ran home.
When she got home the only thing she had left was one slipper.
She did this thing.
But then the young prince realized that this slipper belonged to the woman he wanted to marry and to be his princess forever.
So he says.
We will go scour the valley.
Get everyone who was invited to the ball.
Whosever foot fits this slipper becomes the queen.
He comes on.
He tries it onto the other big footed stepsister.
The mother says.
Then the prince says.
She says.
She do not know.
He says.
There is the slipper on her.
He takes the slipper off and then puts on.
Magically it fits her feet.
The prince realizes that she is cinderella.
Then cinderella stands up.
He sees her for what she is.
Really a wonderful person and not those scullery maid things.
He sees back in that wonderful gown and remembers the dancing.
He proposes marriage.
They lived happily ever after.
First you take two slices of bread.
Apply jelly to one side of one of the pieces of bread after it has been toasted.
There was much much rain.
So much more than ever before that a flood occurred.
A young girl was trapped in this flood.

Rescue workers came.
One man with a lifejacket and silver harnesses was dropped from a helicopter into the flood reaching the girl.
Unfortunately he made a very large mistake and kicked the ball too hard.
The ball flew into the neighbor's yard.
Very very much scaring the man sitting inside watching the television.
The man grabs the soccer ball.
His mother offers him an umbrella which he refuses.
She is clearly troubled that he has refused but let us him go.
As he walks out oh down the road it starts to rain.
He realizes his mistake covers his head and runs back to the house.
Mother sees him and tells him.
I did tell you so.
Which then he uses to walk to school staying after he has been dried dry.
Young cinderella's father meets a woman and marries her.

Wishes that she could be living in a very very better place.
Very very worried that the prince is never going to marry.
The king decides that the prince must marry.
This is sent out to all of the kingdom's eligible women as a message inviting them.
Cinderella finds out from the stepmother and stepsisters who are very very conniving and greedy.
Cinderella finds a stash of her mother's clothing.
Through the help of her friends the mice and the birds builds a beautiful dress.
For she had been told by her stepmother that she would be allowed to go to the ball if she had a dress that fit and was good enough.
Unfortunately oz part of what she made the dress from there were pieces and leftovers of the stepsisters' clothing.
They fly into a rage.

She sees and hears at the same time that midnight is occurring.
She runs as fast as she can away from the prince to hide that she really is wearing pauper clothes.
As she runs down the stairs and is chased by the king's servant one of her glass slippers frees itself from her foot and is left on the steps.
Cinderella enjoys the time with her friends.
Is glad for the experience that she had.
Unable to accept any other woman besides the one that he danced with and uncovered at the ball the prince refuses anyone else's hands in marriage.

A little girl was playing in the park where one of the washes are.
She got pulled into the current.
She started yelling for help.
They called the local fire department.

He picked it up walked over and looked out the window where the ball had come through and did not see anybody out there.
The little boy ran away because he was scared.
But before he gets out the door mom says.
It just might rain today.
The little boy says.
Mom says.
So he starts walking to school and sure enough the rain drops start coming down.
Then it starts pouring.
The little boy says.
I am going to go back and get that umbrella.
As he walks in the door mom is looking at him drenched in rain and says.
What does mama say?
The little boy says.
Mama says i should listen when she tells me to do something.
Mom gives the little boy his umbrella.
He starts walking to school with the umbrella over his head.
Cinderella was a little girl who became an orphan at a young age.
Her uncle decided to take her to live with who later became her stepmother and two stepsisters.
As the years went on cinderella was treated poorly by her stepsisters and her stepmom.
"They would make her clean, wash all the dishes clean the floors, wash their clothes, scrub the floors, do everything that they did not want to do and treat her badly."
Then they got an invitation to go to the ball.
Cinderella and her stepmom and stepsisters were all invited.
So right away all her little friends the little animals decided to sew her a beautiful gown.
Then her stepmom dropped the bomb and said.
You are going to cook and you are going to clean and you are going to make sure that this house is spotless by the time we get back.
She was really looking forward to going.
She was sitting there crying.
She was sitting there crying and then along comes the fairy godmother to save the day.
She touches cinderella with her wand and she is in a beautiful gown.
Then she touches the pumpkin and it turns into a beautiful chariot with horses.
Unbeknownst to her stepmother and sisters cinderella's at the ball dancing and having a ball having fun and dancing with the prince.
Then she turns around.
The clock strikes twelve or one.
I cannot remember.
She says.
So she runs out the door and she loses a slipper but she still has one on.
So she gets home.
She is thinking about how wonderful the ball was.
Then a knock comes at the door.
They say.
We do not know who it belongs to.
So we are going around town letting all the ladies try them on to see who it belongs to because that will be who the prince marries.
She is hoping that she gets to try the shoe on.
So they try it on her.
Sure enough the shoe fits.
Her and the prince live happily ever after.
Sally went bike riding this morning.
As she was riding her bike she saw a cat in the tree.
She yelled.
There is a cat in the tree and it is stuck.
So mister brown comes along.
I will try to get the cat sally.
You stay right there.
Mister brown climbs up the tree and finds himself stuck as well as the dog barks on for him to come back down.
Meanwhile someone hears the noise.
Finally the firemen show up to save the day.
You have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
After a series of unusually late winter early spring storms and a very quick warm warming period the rivers and and the local area overflowed.
There were flash floods and several people were trapped or swept away.
In this case the a young woman was trapped in the river and holding on to a tree for probably a very long time.
She looks tired and very nervous and distressed.
It looks as though that the rescue services or fire technician or whomever seemed to have arrived.
The reason i say that is is the type of belt that is on there.
There is two of them.
That this man risked his life in order to save this woman's life.
The boy is has put on his backpack and way out the door to school as usual.
His his mother is suggesting very strongly.
That i watched the news and i saw that there will be rain showers later.
The boy's saying.
It is not going to rain.
He then goes out the door and turns to say goodbye to his mother but she is reminding him one more time.
Well sure enough mother knows best.
Just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour.
The boy was running back home to get his umbrella.
When he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him.
I told you.
He then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school.
Nothing that any other boy probably had not done in their life.
"The young boy's in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing, breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television, upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window."
"Well in the tradition of good old story books, once upon a time there was a landowner, well well endowed family who adopted a little girl."
The little girl came into a family in which the mother and the two daughters did not really appreciate having her around.
As she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse.
But she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself.
The castle there was a prince and a king.
In order to help the son decide who might be a an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a dance.
Invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom.
One day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that i mentioned.
We can get married to this handsome prince.
So they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would go to the party.
Meanwhile cinderella had been listening and thinking.
But and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book.
One thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help cinderella realize her dreams.
She tried to create a dress and give hope to cinderella that she too could have a better life.
Unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what cinderella had been hoping.
They ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others.
So cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made cinderella to be a very very attractive woman.
Noone could recognize that it was cinderella because indeed she had changed so much.
However the fairy godmother had reminded cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because that is when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be revert to their original shape or character.
So at the stroke of midnight cillarella dashed out of the dance after dancing with the prince and having the time of her life only to leave one glass slipper on the stairs and escape off into the night leaving the poor prince baffled as to who this woman was.
"He then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman, mystery woman."
He carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom.
When he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where cinderella lived he of course wanted to have everyone try it on.
Of course the mother tried but it did not fit.
The sisters tried and the shoe did not fit.
Cinderella tried and it fit.
They lived happily ever after.
Yesterday i was watching the news when i saw this crazy story.
Turned out that this man was going to help his cat that was stuck up in the tree.
So he took the ladder out.
The daughter was very happy that they were going to be able to save the cat.
But once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down.
The girl started panicking.
So she ran and called her mother.
The mother called the fire department.
The fire department came to help him down.
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top.
Oh apparently this girl has fallen into some water that is maybe there is a flood or a storm.
A man is trying to rescue her.
Apparently she is been holding onto a tree branch.
He is trying to get a hold of her.
But she will not let go of the tree branch probably.
About all i can say.
Well hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window.
But the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp.
But obviously the boy has ran away because the man cannot see him when he goes in at the window.
The mother wants to give the the boy an an umbrella.
He does not want it.
So he goes off and gets wet.
He does not like getting wet.
He runs back to his mom who is mad.
He is wet so he takes the umbrella.
Now my son would love getting wet.
Cinderella is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother.
Wicked and stepmother always go together.
She has two ugly stepsisters.
I cannot remember their names.
Anyway cinderella is forced forced to work like a drudge for the the rest of the family who are cruel to her.
An edict comes from the prince that they are going to have a ball.
But cinderella's mother stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready.
At last the girls drive away in their carriage and cinderella's left behind crying in the cinders.
Then i think the stepsisters tore up her dress because yeah they did not want her to go.
So then the fairy godmother enters the picture.
Of course she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the the pumpkin carriage.
"She goes off to the ball where of course she is the bell of the ball, meets the prince."
The prince falls in love with her on sight.
But at twelve of the clock she hasta run off.
She leaves her slipper.
I guess that story goes all the way to the end.
How the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper.
The two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they do not fit.
So he find that she is a true princess and they live happily ever after.
Here is one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree.
Then this the the father has climbed up to rescue the cat.
Now he needs to be rescued.
Nobody has put it up there.
So here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad.
What i like to do is spread the peanut butter first.
Then i open up a jar of jelly.
I usually use a spoon for that.
Take the same knife that i use for peanut butter.
A little girl was riding through the neighborhood on her bike.
Noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree.
Her father came along.
She says.
Well i can get the cat out.
Let me go get my ladder.
Father went and got the ladder.
Then a neighborhood dog came by.
So the man was stuck in the ladder along with the cat.
The fire department hadta be called to rescue them both.
A couple decided they would go white water rafting.
The man told his girlfriend to put on her vest.
She said.
I can swim.
I do not needta put on a vest.
He goes.
Well i am going to put mine on because i think that is just a safe thing to do.
So as they are white water rafting the further down they got the rougher the water became.
As as they continued to go down the water got so rough that fell out of the boat.
Seconds later the boat tipped over.
So both of them are are are are water rapids hitting rocks with the heavy flow of the stream going going by them.
Fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to to stay afloat and last long enough to to float to the edge and grab a branch.
His girlfriend was coming quickly behind him.
As he is hanging onto the branch he is reaching for her.
Early one morning it is time for little johnny to go to school.
Little johnny's about to walk out the door.
But mom stops him.
Johnny you better take this umbrella with you because i heard the forecast.
I think it is going to rain.
Johnny says.
I do not need an umbrella.
She says.
I think you should take it.
No i do not need it.
I will see you later mom.
So as johnny is walking to school it starts to rain.
As johnny is walking he is putting his hands over his head trying to stop all the wetness from falling on his face.
He is hating himself for not having to get that umbrella.
So he races back home.
When his mom opens the door he is soaking wet.
His mom looks at him disappointedly.
See you are all wet because you did not take the umbrella.
Maybe next time you will listen to me.
So johnny took the umbrella.
Went outside while it was still raining.
This time he used it.
He figured.
Hey i guess umbrellas are not for sissies after all.
Bobby loves to play soccer.
He loves playing soccer so much he can even play by himself.
He kicked it so hard boom!
It went right through his neighbor's window.
When it went through the window it went right into the neighbors living room.
Knocked over a lamp close to where a man was sitting.
It startled the man.
The man picked up the ball.
Looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from.
There was once a girl called cinderella.
She did not have any parents.
She lived in an orphanage.
So she lived in an orphanage.
The orphanage was looking for a family to take her.
So they put out a notice.
A mother two daughters showed up at the orphanage to see cinderella to take her in.
They saw cinderella.
The orphanage director introduced cinderella.
She cinderella did a curtsy.
Pleasure to meet you.
They took cinderella away.
Once they got cinderella home cinderella found out that the stepmother was really mean and so were the stepsisters.
All they made her do was chores all day long.
Cinderella do this.
Cinderella do that.
Cinderella get my food.
Cinderella do the laundry.
Cinderella feed the animals the cats the dog the horses.
All later later that evening a invitation came to the house from the king inviting all the unmarried ladies to the prince's ball so that perhaps the prince could find somebody to marry.
So everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball.
She thought she would be going too.
While she was cleaning she went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress.
So she went ahead and tried the dress on.
However when the stepmothers and stepsisters came in and saw her dress and also the jewelry she was wearing she says.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Cinderella says.
Well i am going we have all been invited to the ball.
The evil stepsisters and the stepmother said.
You are not going.
You are staying here.
Nobody's going to want to marry you.
They snatched the jewelry off of her.
They snatched the dress off of her.
You are not going anywhere.
We are going to the ball.
One of us will marry the prince.
But you have got to stay home because nobody wants to marry you anyway.
So off to the ball they went.
Cinderella stayed at home.
She was crying.
Before you knew it she was crying so hard all of a sudden she started hearing bells.
There is twinkling all around.
A fairy godmother appeared.
Cinderella says.
I am here to to grant your wish to go to the ball.
Cinderella says.
Well i cannot go because i do not have a dress.
I do not have a way to get there.
So the fairy godmother waved her magic wand.
She says.
But i do not have any shoes.
She may waved her magic wand again and and there was some glass slippers for her.
So she put on the glass slippers.
So they walked outside.
Cinderella said that.
I do not have a way to get there.
The fairy godmother says.
The dog seems to like you too.
So fairy godmother waved her magic wand.
The pumpkin turned into a carriage.
The mice turned into horses.
The dog turned into a chauffeur.
She got into the carriage.
Off to the ball they went.
When cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty.
They could not believe how incredible she looked.
Ah but as much fun as cinderella was having one thing that her fairy godmother had told her.
She says she needed to be back by midnight.
She says if she was not back by midnight the carriage was going to turn back into a pumpkin.
That the horses were going to turn back into mice.
That the chauffeur chauffeur was going to turn back into the dog.
So cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then.
She was having so much fun she lost track the time.
When she looked up at the clock she noticed that it was almost twelve of the clock.
While she was dancing with the prince she quickly broke away from him and says.
I got to go i got to go.
The prince says.
No you cannot go.
I think i found my true love.
Cinderella continued to run.
I got to go.
I must go.
As cinderella was running out she left a shoe behind.
She hesitated for a second to get it but realized she did not have enough time.
So she quickly hopped into the carriage.
The carriage drove drove off.
The clothes turned to rags.
The carriage turned into a pumpkin.
The horse turned into mice.
The chauffeur turned into the dog.
Back at the palace the prince while he was chasing cinderella noticed that there was a glass slipper that was still there.
So he picked up the glass slipper and said.
I must find this woman.
Whosever woman's foot can fit into this shoe that is the person that i am going to marry.
So so the prince went from house to house looking for females to fit that shoe.
None of the female's foot would fit into the glass slipper.
So finally he came to cinderella's house.
As the prince arrived the mother and the evil stepsisters they locked cinderella into the closet.
Where she could not get out.
So the prince came in.
The two daughters tried on the shoe with all their might.
They could not put their feet into it.
However her friends the little mice noticed that that the prince was there.
So they found a key to the room.
They gave it to cinderella so that she could open the door.
The prince could see that there was another woman in the house.
So the prince asked her to try on the shoe.
She did.
Magically you know she transformed back into the lady that he saw that night.
And the prince realized.
The prince realized that he had found the love of his life.
So they got together.
They they drove back to the palace.
Got married.
Folding the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and the jelly touching each other all aligned correctly.
An airplane went down into the potomac with ninety some odd people aboard.
Some of them managed to get out of the plane into the water.
One of the rescue team tried to get to her.
It successfully rescued her brought her to shore.
Unfortunately there were a number of fatalities but most of the people were rescued and brought back into shore.
When his mother cautions him that it is going to be raining and that he is going to need an umbrella he insists.
I will just chance it.
Goes out and ends up in the rain and runs back home soaking wet where he picks up the umbrella and goes back off to school.
"A boy is playing soccer outside, kicks the ball into the window of a neighbor's property where it goes through the window and lands in the lap of a man who is sitting in his easy chair."
It obviously breaks a lamp.
The boy has hidden so he does not know who has done it.
But rage over the incident toppled over the chair the lamp and the table and knocked them out of the way and is very frustrated over the situation.
Okay a soon to be wicked stepmother is living with her daughters when somebody brings a little girl to stay with them.
"The little girl is very polite , curtsies to the family and thinks that she is going to be spending time on an equal footing with the rest of the family."
However while the mother and daughters are busy primping themselves and having a good time she is left to work with the farm animals and gets to know them and takes care of them.
She is spends her time sometimes looking out of the window at the faroff castle in the distance wondering what life would be like in the big castle.
Turning to the castle the king is very upset because his son has not taken a bride.
He brings his top advisor to to develop a strategy to find a wife for his son because he does not want to die and relinquish his crown to his son without a wife to carry on the line.
They decide to put an announcement out to all eligible families with eligible young women.
A bulletin which ends up at the house of the wicked stepmother and her daughters.
They read the notice.
"Cinderella listens and finds out about it, goes up into the bedroom and moans and longs to put on a beautiful dress that she sees there wanting to go to the ball herself."
The family gets ready and apparently they buy the sisters all all stuff to get ththem up to go to the ball.
Cinderella is left alone when all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and says.
I am your fairy godmother and i am going to take care of everything you want.
I know you want to go to the ball.
We can do it.
She plunks her magic wand and suddenly the mice turn into horses.
A pumpkin turns into a a coach.
"She makes up a pair of glass slippers and a dress for cinderella, plunks her magic wand again, fixes cinderella's hair."
Cinderella in her glass slippers gets up into the carriage and goes to the ball arriving at the ball in style with the carriage man who was a cat.
But in any event she forgets the fairy godmother's warning that she must be back by midnight.
She is having such a good time with the prince dancing.
I think it is the glass slippers.
"Anyway he decides that this is the girl for him and she is swept off her feet, when all of a sudden she hears the gonging of the bell tower and realizes that it is midnight."
"She rushes off to get back into the carriage, runs down the steps of the castle, tripping, losing one of her glass slippers hobbles onto the carriage."
Carriage goes off.
"Just in the nick of time the carriage turns back into a pumpkin, the horse into mice."
Cinderella is left weeping in her she would with the animals and looking at the glass slipper remembering the great time she had at the ball and realizing that it is all for naught.
Meanwhile the prince has told his father he has found the woman of his dreams.
She has lost a glass slipper behind her.
If the king's advisors go around and have different women the glass slipper he will find his beloved who must fit the slipper.
"Not realizing that eighty women kingdom or a hundred and eighty women kingdom all are a size five slipper, his his father's advisor goes to the house of cinderella first where all the girls try on the glass slipper trying to get into it."
They see cinderella.
They ask her to try on the glass slipper.
Sure enough it fits.
She is brought back to the castle where she weds the prince.
"They get married, lived happily ever after, have three children."
Two two boys who end up fighting over the kingdom thirty years later.
The kingdom breaks out into civil war.
First i get the bread out of the refrigerator.
Then i get the peanut butter out of the cupboard.
Then i get the jelly out of the refrigerator.
Then i put the bread on a plate.
I spread the bread with peanut butter after getting out a knife.
Then i use the knife to spread jelly over the peanut butter.
Then i put the other piece of bread on top of the peanut butter and jelly spread over the bread.
Well joshua the cat was stuck in a tree.
Mary was panicking.
"Oh so mary's dad got a ladder, climbed up the tree to get the cat for mary."
In the meantime the ladder fell.
The dad was stuck in the tree with the cat.
In the meantime the firemen were coming to rescue both of them.
So there was a happy ending to this because the firemen were going to take care of the whole thing and rescue everybody.
Here i don quite get it.
It it looks like there are two people that were rafting and fell out of the boat.
The girl caught up in a whirlpool.
The guy was hanging onto a branch.
She looked really concerned.
He he looks more fearful than she does.
She looks like she is more concerned than he is.
So the story is that one of them is trying to rescue the other one.
I am just not sure who is trying to rescue who here.
She is not holding onto anything but she is caught up in a whirlpool.
She looks more concerned about him.
He looks a little bit petrified.
But he is got the lifejacket on so he is probably the one that cannot swim.
He kicked the ball so hard that it went through the window smashed the window and landed in his dad's den where dad was watching tv.
"Dad got up and looked out the window, caught the ball, and saw that joey had run away."
But dad knew.
Mom said to larry.
Larry i would really like you to take this umbrella with you today because it is going to rain.
Larry said.
No i don need it mom.
It is look look there is no rain.
So larry was walking to school and it started to rain.
Larry did not have the umbrella.
He said.
Oh i should have taken that umbrella.
When he did get home mom was standing there angry at hi am because he did not take the umbrella.
He was soaking wet.
So from there on after larry listened to his mom and took the umbrella every time she am suggested it.
Cinderella was a beautiful young woman who had two stepsisters and a stepmother that came into her family when her dad married.
Bebecause her mother had died.
Cinderella hadta scrub floors and work hard and wear rags.
Whereas the stepsisters had all the beautiful clothes and all the wonderful attention and love from the stepmother cinderella did not have.
So one day there was an invitation for all three.
There was an invitation to go to a ball.
Cinderella was not included in the invitation because the stepmother wanted her two stepdaughters to go and meet the prince.
There was a prince that was looking for a bride.
So the stepsisters got all dressed up and ready to go.
Cinderella was left feeling very left out.
But cinderella turned out to have a fairy godmother who dressed her up in the most gorgeous dress so that she was the most exquisite person at the ball.
And she had all these little mice scurrying around to help her.
All of a sudden a pumpkin coach arrived with the fairy godmother's wave of the wand.
Cinderella dressed up beautifully got in the coach went to the ball.
But the fairy godmother said.
You hafta be home by twelve of the clock in midnight in order for this to work.
So cinderella met the the prince.
The two stepsisters were raving mad because she was so beautiful.
And the prince and cinderella had a wonderful time together.
But then cinderella realized she hadta be on the way out by twelve of the clock.
So she ran down the steps of the ballroom to get back into the the the coach and left one of her shoes on the steps.
She was in such a hurry her shoe fell off.
So the prince spent sent out all of his messengers in order to find the woman that belonged to this shoe.
Because he knew that he was in love with her and that they would live happily ever after.
So finally they arrived.
The two stepsisters were out there prince's messenger came to the door to find out who belonged to the shoe.
Somehow cinderella was found in the drama about the stepsisters wanting to marry the prince.
I do not know where cinderella was.
But she ended up being found by the prince.
They lived happily ever.
Oh i do not like it.
He was climbing up on the limb when he got stuck on the tree.
The she was trying to help her kitty get down.
In the meantime the the dog's going up the trunk to save them.
Then somebody musta called the fire engine.
The firemen come with a ladder to come get ththem down from the tree.
They are riding in a boat.
The boat flips over.
He manages to grab a branch off a tree i think.
But she did not grab anything.
Ball went through a window.
A man was sitting on a chair.
The ball hit the the lamp.
The man has the ball and is looking at the window.
But what happened to the lamp?
What happened to the lamp?
The mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella but he does not want to.
So he starts walking.
It starts raining.
So when he is getting er rain on his head.
He is going back to his mother.
He now he is got an umbrella.
But how did he get the umbrella?
Now he is walking up with the umbrella.
But how did he get the umbrella?
I forgot the beginning.
I forgot the beginning.
She was doing housework.
The ugly stepsisters were going to a party.
How did she have the glass slipper?
I forgot.
Oh the fairy godmother comes into the picture.
She musta given her the glass slipper.
Then the prince found the glass slipper.
He puts it on her.
They take off in a carriage.
Okay the little girl's cat got stuck in a tree.
So the father climbed the tree to get the cat out.
His ladder fell.
He got stuck in the tree.
The dog was barking at him and the cat.
The the fire department hadta come.
Two two fire firemen brought a ladder to get the man out of the tree.
You get your jar of peanut butter jar of jelly.
There ya have it.
There is two people in the water.
It it looks to me that there is a man trying to save a little girl that is drownding.
There is a belt.
I think he is got a looped around a branch or something.
But i he has a lifejacket on.
He's trying to save a girl from drowning in a river.
He has a soccer ball.
He kicks it.
It goes through a window breaks the window knocks over a lamp.
There is a man sitting in a chair next to the lamp.
He gets really scared.
Picks up the ball and looks out the broken window.
The little boy is getting ready to leave and go out.
The mother insists that he takes an umbrella.
He says.
I do not need it.
They argue a little bit.
She gives in.
He so he leaves.
He is walking down the road.
He sees that it starts to rain.
So and it starts raining really hard so he rushes back to the house.
He is covering his head.
He is getting all wet.
He goes back into the house.
He is soaking wet.
She looks at him as if ta say.
I told you so.
So then he gets the umbrella and uses it.
Goes back out and uses the umbrella and starts walking down the road again.
Okay cinderella's father married a woman which was became her stepmother.
The stepmother had two daughters.
So they all moved in together.
Then the father died.
So cinderella was left in the care of the wicked stepmother.
I think called her names and made her do all their chores as well.
So she she made friends with all the animals.
An announcement came.
Someone came to the door and announced that there was going to be a ball.
So they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball.
Since cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters the mother did not want her to go.
Because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince.
So she locked cinderella in the tower.
They went to the ball.
So the the animals made.
Oh oh well this was before the animals made cinderella a dress.
That is what infuriated the stepmother.
She tore up the dress.
Then cinderella was crying.
Then the fairy godmother came.
With the magical wave of her wand made her a beautiful gown and glass slippers.
She met the prince danced with him.
The fairy godmother told her that she hadta leave by midnight or she everything would return as it was.
So she was dancing with the prince.
The clock started to strike midnight.
She said.
I hafta go.
He did not want her to leave.
But she started to run away.
She lost one of the glass slippers.
She ran and ran and got back in the coach.
They started going down the road.
Then every ding when the clock struck twelve turned back to the way it was.
She was very sad but she had a good time.
She realized that she still had one of the glass slippers.
So she went home.
So they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyone is foot.
It wouldn fit anybody.
He finally came to cinderella's house.
They tried the slippers on the stepsisters and and it would not fit.
Then they were going to try it on cinderella.
The stepmother tripped the the the little guy with the slipper.
And he tripped and fell and broke the slipper.
Oh well the slipper's broken.
You cannot try it on cinderella.
Then cinderella said.
But i have the other slipper.
So right then and there the prince knew that she was the one.
A little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree.
Apparently a man has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder.
He is attempted to get the cat down.
He himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down.
A dog may well have accompanied him.
There was a dog there.
The fire department has also arrived with their ladder.
They are approaching the scene.
They are certainly going to get the cat down along with the man more than likely.
The first step is to assemble the items you need.
A typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread.
How i would go about doing it i would put spread jelly on on one slice of bread.
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread.
I would put the two of them together.
I cannot be certain of what happened.
But clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water.
The authorities were alerted because it appears that a a professional is attempting to rescue her.
He has on rescue equipment.
I really cannot give an end to the story because i do not know what the outcome of the situation was.
I assume she was saved.
But there is no telling based on this photograph.
There is a young boy.
He is kicking about a soccer ball.
We see the soccer ball go through a window of a house.
Knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it.
We then see him with the ball in his hand.
He is looking out the broken window.
He i cannot tell that he is glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption.
I am not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother removed it from his hand.
He is still asking for it.
Well he has a backpack on so i assume he is headed off to school but not necessarily.
He is walking.
He sees raindrops falling.
The rain picks up.
He is getting soaked.
It appears he is turned around.
He is returned home.
His mother is looking at his his drenched body.
Then he was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain.
She as the story progresses one of the wealthy gentleman.
He is trying to i believe marry off his son.
There is a ball being held.
Cinderella is not invited because she she has been rather outcast by the family as just the the servant girl.
It turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the the ability to go to the ball i suppose you would say.
She goes there in this fancy fancy vehicle.
She is she is wearing glass slippers.
When she arrives she happens to get a dance with the son of the the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son.
So she is she is dancing with the son and it it turns out that the son is is rather enamored by her.
So but the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by i believe it was midnight something.
Or else she turns into a pumpkin something like that.
But regardless she it gets close to midnight.
She realizes this.
She darts off.
Leaves the the prince or the son of the wealthy landowner whoever he was kind of depressed that she hadta leave early.
She happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers.
The prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her her foot.
So and then you know they are together again.
The the other sisters are who had planned on one of them getting the the guy they are kind of left in the dark.
And everyone kind of gets their their comeuppance.
Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after.
Well you go to the cabinet.
The cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog.
The dad said.
To the little girl bebecause she was crying her cat was out in the tree.
I will get the cat down for you.
So the dad got up on the ladder to the tree to get the cat.
But the ladder fell down.
The dad is caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down.
So the firemen have been called.
They are coming in to bring another ladder to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy.
There is a bird singing in the tree.
So it all ends when the firemen get the dad and the cat down.
Well there was a flash flood in the deserts of arizona which happens frequently.
They think they can drive their car out through this dry wash bed that all of a sudden has a trickle of water.
They get their car out there.
The trickle becomes a flood.
They hafta get out of their car.
They are standing on the roof.
The firemen come.
The rescue people come.
The little girl falls off of the car into the raging flood waters.
She is holding onto a branch.
The firemen come out and rescue her.
The boy is playing soccer out at his yard.
He kicks the ball.
It breaks one of the windows.
It lands in the living room where the dad is sitting.
It breaks the window.
But it also breaks the lamp.
The dad gets up.
The little boy is going off to school.
He walks to school.
His mother says.
Well it looks like it might rain today.
You better take the umbrella.
He said.
Oh no i do not need an umbrella.
I i i do not think it is going to rain.
So off he goes with his backpack.
Sure enough it starts raining.
He gets soaking wet.
It is raining very very hard.
He runs back to the house.
He is soaking wet.
But she gives him the umbrella.
Back out he goes to school with the umbrella keeping him dry.
Cinderella lost her mother.
Her father married a new person a a woman.
A and so cinderella had a stepmother.
But the stepmother also had two girls.
So they came in and were living with cinderella.
The father did not realize this but the stepmother was really treating cinderella mean.
He she had her cleaning and washing while her daughters were being treated very very nicely.
Cinderella felt very sad.
Well there was a prince in the land.
There was the the castle.
The king and the queen wanted their prince to get married.
They were looking for the best wife for for him.
They were going to have a ball to introduce him to all the single ladies in the kingdom.
Cinderella wanted to go.
But the stepmother said.
You do not have the right kind of clothes.
Your hair is not done right.
So the the stepsisters were getting ready.
The book talks about her going up in the attic or down in the basement finding this chest with a book.
This part i do not know but anyway.
She calls on a fairy godmother to come and and help her.
The fairy godmother gives her this beautiful dress.
She has a coach.
Off she goes to the ball.
But she is being told that everything is going to go back to the way it was at the stroke of midnight.
So her coachmen are going to turn into mice.
Her coach is going to turn into a pumpkin.
But off she goes.
She dances with the prince.
She falls in love with him.
But then she hears the clock stuhtriking striking twelve.
She knows that this is all going to just collapse.
About that time it the clock strikes midnight.
But she has lost one of her slippers on the stairway as she ran down from the castle.
So the prince wants to find this beautiful young lady.
He says whoever can fit into this slipper will be my new princess.
He they search high and low.
Y go into the house of the stepmother daughters and cinderella.
They try on the shoes.
They will not fit.
But cinderella tries on the shoe.
It fits perfect.
So the prince knows that this is his princess.
They live happily ever after.
Well you get the ingredients out.
You get the the bread that you would want to use.
I would first take a paper plate and put the two slices of bread on the plate.
Then either before or after i would go get the jelly and the peanut butter.
Then i would take two knives bebecause i do not want to adulterate one or the other.
I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly.
I would the put the butter on the one side.
Probably the right side just bebecause it is that is where it is at in my mind.
I would put it on evenly.
But i would put it on very over the whole area.
Not this area bebecause i hate that.
An then i would do the likewise with the jelly.
I would probably use a little less jelly than the the peanut butter because i would rather have more peanut butter.
So the two surfaces that have stuff on it face each other.
I would put ththem so you know the top of the piece is where it has a symmetrical.
Then i would cut it in half probably this way horizontally.
Then know what eat it.
I do not know if you want to know that so.
At some point i would probably at the end i would clean up my mess so my wife would not yell at me.
Looks like there is a kitty got up into the branch of a tree.
It looks like the father climbed up on the tree with a ladder.
Somehow the ladder fell down.
The father is stuck in the tree.
There is a girl up there reaching up for probably her cat.
There is a tricycle next to her.
There is a ladder there that is quite a ways from the tree.
So i do not understand how it got that far away.
But maybe it tipped over backwards.
Then there is a dog probably their dog barking up the tree.
You know why i have no idea what dogs do.
Then there is a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree.
Then evidently somebody called a fire department.
There is a firetruck.
There is a couple fireman carrying a ladder towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there.
So evidently the father climbed up the tree to get the cat out.
For some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down.
Somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the fire department.
They are responding.
An they are going to get him out.
Oh i get it now.
I did not get what this was to begin with.
Looks like there was a young girl.
I do not know.
I cannot tell really tell the age.
Looks like that she was in a an area where there was rocky or stony or cliff type things.
She evidently fell into the.
It looks like on the.
I cannot really see that.
She evidently got fell in.
She hanged onto a a dead tree's branch out of the rocks.
Looks like there is probably some man.
By the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person.
He is got a belt that i do not know if that is connected to a rope or not.
I cannot really see that.
You know looks like that the.
Oh i see what it is.
He is got a belt he is going to probably put around her.
Okay i did not see that.
It looks like he is just got to the point where he is up by next to her and he is going to when he gets a chance put the belt around the girl and rescue her.
He is got a a gigantic bicept so.
The girl she looks a little scared.
I mean she looks a little shocked out too or something.
So i would assume it had a happy ending.
So i i do not know about that.
A boy playing with a i guess that is a soccer ball.
He got a baseball cap on.
He kicks it and it appears to go through a window.
It breaks the window.
It lands inside a house.
It knocks a lamp off a a table.
There is a man that was evidently sitting in there.
I think it looks like it maybe startled him or something.
He picked up the ball.
He is looking out the window.
Does not you know cannot see his expression on his face.
But he probably either stages of finding out you know who did it or whatever.
Then he is probably going to react to it one way or the other.
Well looks like there is a mother offering to a child.
I do not know.
No it is got.
Unbrella an looks like the person probably the boy declines it.
He goes out.
He is starting to get wet.
He does not seem too happy about that.
So he comes back.
His mother seems to not that be happy about it either.
So then the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now.
He is you know using it the proper way.
That he is getting most of the rain not go on his upper upper body.
Does not say if they he was dried out before that or not.
But he does not seem to be wet from the picture.
So i no really know.
Well i would like to say that being a european i was not brought up to enjoy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
But i have learned to make them for various visits that i have from my grandchildren.
I would get two slices of wheat bread which i enjoy very much.
I first i would get the peanut butter jar out of the cupboard.
Not the fridge because you do not needta put peanut butter in the fridge.
I would take a knife out of the drawer.
I would put the peanut butter on one side of the piece one piece of bread.
Okay the little girl's pet cat climbed very high into a tree.
She she had been cycling around.
She suddenly saw her cat in the tree.
She called her father to climb the tree to help to get the cat down.
The dog was barking at the base of the tree.
The mother in in meantime had obviously called the fire brigade to get dad down out of the tree.
That is the end of the story as i see it.
This story took place in new orleans at the time of katrina.
When the whole city of new orleans was flooded this little girl was washed away by the the the water that had come through the dikes.
This young man happened to be standing on the edge of the quay.
Both their lives were saved at that time.
Little johnny had been warned by his father not to play with the football close to the house.
He promises dad he would not do that.
However he got so taken away by his new football that he was kicking it.
The ball flew through the window.
I told you not to do that.
It was time for little johnny to go to school.
Because the weather was looking gray and cloudy outside his mom said.
Johnny do take an umbrella with you.
No mom i do not need an umbrella.
He says.
So off he walks.
He would only been gone a few minutes before the rain started.
Of course he was feeling very guilty.
He ran back home.
His mum said.
Johnny i wish you would listen to what i am telling you.
He said.
So he walked off with his umbrella.
Little cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died.
After which her father married a second time to a a middleaged woman who he fell in love with who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters.
Poor little cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother her stepmother and the daughters.
She did all the ironing the cleaning and everything else.
Because she was such a nice person she did it willingly because she had a good heart.
One day the old king approached his son and said.
It is about time you got married.
I am going to throw a ball.
You i hope will find your future wife at the ball.
The the prince was not too keen on the idea but finally he agreed.
When the the stepmother ugly sisters found out about this ball they they tried their level best to make themselves look as well as they could.
They they bought new clothes.
They they did their hair.
They they made themselves as presentable as they could.
Cinderella in the meantime was looked out of her window.
Saw the the castle big ball was taking place.
Wished so very much that she could also go to the ball.
She was helped by her little friends the mice and and the owl.
They all said.
Oh cinderella why do not you try and contact your fairy godmother?
Well cinderella said.
I do not know how to do that.
They said.
There is a book in the trunk.
If you read how to find your fairy godmother she might turn up and be able to help you.
She did that.
Whan the the fairy godmother approached.
Cinderella you shall go to the ball.
She suddenly with with her magic was able to provide cinderella with a coach made out of a pumpkin.
Coachmen she changed the mice into coachmen.
She made cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress.
She said.
You go and you have a good time my child but remember one thing.
When the clock strikes midnight you must already have returned from the ball.
So cinderella promised to do that.
She went to the ball.
The prince fell madly in love with her and she with him.
They were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock twelve.
So she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could.
That was the only thing that the prince hadta identify her with.
Shortly after that the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman.
He who had no idea who she was.
The only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper.
So he sent a courtier around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper.
Anyone who can put this slipper on must be my cinderella and i will marry her.
Of course the courtier arrived at cinderella's house.
The mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and of course could not do that until cinderella said.
I would like to try.
She did.
They married and lived happily ever after.
Well we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old wonder bread which is hardly bread at all.
It is whatever you feel like at the time.
Well having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading.
My way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first.
Others do it differently but this is how i recommend it.
It works better.
Spread spread the.
This way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread.
"Now having done so , what a lot of people fail to have ever learned is you know regardless of how much bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth."
Well there is an easy way around that.
Most people do not know my special secret.
It makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had.
From what i see i have not the foggiest idea of what is really going on.
I see a man who appears to be lying possibly lying on his back.
I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch.
Over his left shoulder looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish.
You know i do not know if she even knows what to do.
I do not know any more than that.
I mean i can tell you what i see which is some kind of a belt which he has around his left arm.
He appears to be quite muscular.
She appears to be very concerned.
That is as much as i can tell you.
A boy has a soccer ball which he kicks.
It goes into the air.
It encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it.
A man sitting in a chair looks like an easy chair is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp.
"He then stands, picks up the soccer ball, looks out the window to see."
Let us see how did it get here?
His mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella.
Well he refuses.
He is going to be very brave.
Nothing's going to stop him.
He does not need an umbrella.
Out he goes into the weather.
It is raining.
It is raining hard.
It is raining so hard that he is stepping in puddles.
He is getting soaked.
He returns home much to the conversation of his mom.
Well apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella.
But she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters.
"They were pampered, spoiled and they were nasty."
Cinderella was called cinderella because her real name was ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace.
She hadta cinders and do things like that.
It so happened that the prince of the kingdom decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one.
The two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother got invitations to go.
Poor cinderella thought she hadta stay home.
But because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared out of nowhere and said to her.
Look you deserve to go.
We could arrange this but there are conditions.
First of all there will be a coach for you pulled by horses.
There will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers.
The biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what is occurring at at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be out of there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin.
Cinderella went to the ball.
The prince could not take his eyes of her because she was so good and so beautiful.
She had a wonderful time.
But all of a sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve.
She knew she hadta get the heck out of there really fast.
In so doing she dropped one of her slippers.
But it did not make any difference.
She got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home.
Well the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away.
But that did not matter because he wanted her.
So he decreed that a search would occur kingdom until woman was found.
Well cinderella had tiny feet.
The glass slipper was so tiny that very few grownups could fit into it.
So he he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who who whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one.
Cinderella as the one who whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper.
They were married and lived happily ever after.
We see here a tree.
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs holding on to it sort of so to speak and barking.
In largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of rescuing a cat who is on one of the smaller branches.
Under directly underneath of which is a little girl who who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down.
She has a tricycle in front of her.
We see near the little girl a ladder on the ground which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is.
Although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains on the ground.
That is see to the left left side of the trunk of a tree.
On the right side is another branch which had a few leaves on it.
On its branches is a bird who appears to be singing.
"At the same time we see distance directly to the right of the truck a firetruck and two what appear to be two firemen each each carrying an end of a ladder which presumably they will use to climb the tree , rescue the man and probably the cat as well."
Okay it looks like they have problems with their pets.
I have a cat.
So i know that cats climb anywhere.
It does not look like the cat is stressed.
But the little girl is stressed.
So daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat.
But i do not think he is able to.
So he calls the firemen.
The firemen look like they are going to get the cat down.
I am just going to assume that they got the cat down.
The little kid is going to be so excited.
They probably hafta also get the daddy down.
They live happily ever after.
Okay you take the the loaf of bread.
You open the bag.
You get your peanut butter jar.
You get your knife.
So that both pieces of bread have peanut butter on it.
Then you get your favorite jelly.
You do the same thing.
Then you put ththem together.
First of all it looks like there has been a weather change.
So whatever the girl was doing at the beginning i would say she was.
I cannot tell if it is a young girl or if it is a young lady.
I am going to say it is a young girl riding a bicycle.
She the weather came up quickly.
It looks like it is flooding the roadway.
Perhaps she was i am just going to say a on a bicycle.
So it washed her haway.
It looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb.
So he is coming to rescue the little girl.
The family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land.
This young boy is practicing soccer.
As happens many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood.
It goes in a way that it should not have gone.
So he is kicking this soccer ball.
It accidently crashes through a window.
I am going to say it is a neighbor's window.
The neighbor is sitting in a chair.
This ball comes through.
Then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window.
Is looking outside the broken window to the young man.
Being that it is a neighbor i think that he knows that accidents do happen.
He is not happy what happened.
His mom is sort of insisting that he even though it is not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast.
He should take this umbrella.
Kids do not like to take things like that.
They would rather have the rain probably and play in the rain.
But he is insisting that he does not want to take the umbrella.
It starts raining.
But then all of a sudden it is really coming down.
You can see the puddles on the ground.
So he is trying to cover his head with his hand.
He is turned around to go back home.
He comes in.
He is very sad because he is soaked.
His mother looks at him.
Is disappointed that he did not take the umbrella.
But now he realizes that his mother was right.
He should have taken the umbrella.
He goes out using the umbrella.
Though it is pouring down rain he is now keeping dry.
It is a story of a mother that has three daughters.
Two seem to be mean sisters to their one sister who is cinderella.
They always have fun.
They dress up.
They go places.
Cinderella is left to do the chores the hard work.
Feeding the animals cooking cleaning the house.
Then they get an invitation to a ball.
The prince has invited everybody to come to the ball.
So they are all excited because they are going to go to the ball.
Well cinderella gets dressed.
Her sisters get dressed.
They take some of their things that she was going to wear for themselves.
So now cinderella really does not want to go because she does not look pretty.
So the other two sisters go to the ball.
Then all of a sudden the fairy godmother comes.
You are going to the ball.
Cinderella looks beautiful.
So she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball.
She has on beautiful silver slippers.
So all of a sudden she gets to the ball.
If she does not get out by midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin.
So she runs away from the prince.
Somehow she lost her one shoe.
The prince finds the shoe.
They try to find the person that this shoe fits.
He has help.
Other people are helping him.
So finally they they try to fit the shoe on the two mean sisters.
It does not fit.
But then they said.
There was one other person here.
Cinderella it fit cinderella.
So the prince takes cinderella.
Little leah was riding her bike with her cat on a nice pretty day.
All of a sudden her cat gets scared by a dog.
The dog is running after the cat.
The cat runs up a tree.
This man comes by to help leah get the cat.
He gets a ladder.
He puts it up on the tree.
But the ladder falls.
They cannot get to.
They put the ladder up.
Okay i would come back in from planting the flower.
I would bring my tea with me.
I would go to the refrigerator.
I would get the jelly out.
Then i would go into the pantry.
I would get the bread and the peanut butter.
Then i would go to the drawer.
I would put the bread down on the paper plate.
I would put jelly on one side peanut butter on the other.
Then i would put all the stuff back bebecause i would get in trouble if i did not.
Leah was driving down the road.
Suddenly she got caught in one of these washes that were full of water.
It was rushing so fast that the car was swamped over.
She could just barely open the door.
She got out.
Luckily fortunately there was a helicopter up.
Them a they lowered a a rescue guy down with a rope.
They tied leah up with the the harness.
They lifted her up to safety.
But the car did not make it.
He got carried away.
Fred was sitting in the house watching t v and crash!
He stands up.
He is got the soccer ball in his hand.
He looks out.
He said.
Louie we needta talk about this broken window.
We needta see if we can do something for you to pay for all the damage.
Louie's getting ready to go to school.
So mom says.
Ya might need it.
Louie says.
I do not need the umbrella mom.
So he goes out.
He gets about halfway to school.
It starts raining.
It starts raining harder and harder.
He just turns around.
Mom says.
I told you louie to take this umbrella.
Now now will you take it?
He says.
So off he goes.
The umbrella's protecting him from the rain.
Once upon a time back in the good oldd days cinderella lived with her father.
Cinderella's father met this lady that had two daughters.
They moved in with cinderella and her dad.
They did not like cinderella at all.
They kind of made her into a a a maid sorta thing.
Cinderella would look at the castle.
In that castle they decided to have a ball to see if they could find a girlfriend for prince charming.
So they sent out invitations.
They cinderella got one.
But their her stepsisters would not let her go.
They were going to go instead.
But cinderella called on a fairy godmother.
She dressed cinderella just so beautiful.
The mice and the birds all helped.
Cinderella looked beautiful in her glass slippers.
But the fairy godmother says.
You better be careful because at midnight all this goes away.
You you go back to being cinderella.
So you hafta get everything done by midnight.
So sure enough she met prince charming.
Prince charming just went head over heels over this lovely cinderella with.
They danced.
They danced.
They danced.
Bang twelve of the clock came.
Cinderella hadta run and leave because she would turn back to whatever she was before.
So she ran away.
As she was running away she drops one of her glass slippers.
Leaves it laying there.
But she goes back.
Suddenly she becomes cinderella again.
The prince charming is so sad that his lovely cinderella was gone and he could not find her.
So he assigns a bunch of people with the glass slipper that he found to go around his kingdom.
Try on this glass slipper to find the girl that it fit.
So first he went and went.
They searched and searched and could not go.
They went to cinderella's house.
They tried the glass slipper on both of his step mean stepsisters.
They tried to get the shoe on.
It did not fit.
They saw cinderella over there in the corner.
They said.
Come over here we will try you too.
So she goes over there.
It fits!
Everything goes great.
They live happily ever after.
I will get two slices of bread.
I will get a knife to spread the peanut butter.
I will also get a knife to spread the jelly along with the jar of jelly.
I will first put the peanut butter on one slice of the bread.
I will either put the jelly on top of the peanut butter or put the jelly on the other slice of the bread and put the two slices together with the jelly and the peanut butter in the middle.
Well it looks like the little girl's kitten got stuck up in a tree.
Dad went up to help her out and get it down.
Then he got stuck in the tree.
So they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down out of the tree.
This girl has fallen into the river from somewhere.
I am not sure if she is had a car accident and got out of the car or if she just fell into the river or the was walking swimming in the river and it swept her away.
It looks like there is a rescue person.
I do not know if it is a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the limb to try to get her out of the water.
At this point i think he is talking to her trying to get her out of the water.
She has her head out of the water.
So i am assuming she is not in the process of being sucked down.
I think they are trying to figure out a way to safely get both of them back to shore.
It accidentally goes astray and breaks his window in his home and lands close to his father knocking the lamp over.
"His father surprised gets up picks up the ball , looks out and sees the son."
Father's standing there remembering his days of youth when he accidentally hit a baseball into his parents' window.
Mom's trying to get her son to take an umbrella to school because as you can see it is dark outside.
Son says.
No mom do not need it.
Son starts walking to school.
The rain starts coming.
He is getting soaking wet.
"He runs back home , stands by mom looking forlorn and says."
Okay i will take the umbrella.
She gives him him the umbrella.
He gets some dry clothes on and starts back off to school in a much happier mood.
A father met a woman that he liked.
They got married.
He had a daughter by previous wife.
She had two daughters by previous husband.
The stepmother to his daughter did not want her in the same category as her two daughters.
So mom really took that to extremes and basically turned her into a servant to wait on her and the two sisters.
It came about that the king and queen had a son.
A prince if you will who was celebrating his twenty first birthday.
They decided to have a huge ball and invite all of the eligible girls in the country to come to the ball.
So naturally the stepmother of cinderella who was by then given this name by her mother and sisters since since she tended all the cinders from the fireplace to come to this ball.
Mom decided that her daughters were going and wearing the finest clothes possible.
So she got them their gowns and got them all set up to go.
Cinderella was very sad because she could not go.
She really wanted to go.
She never got to do anything.
She happened to stumble upon some clothes in an old chest and found that she actually had some friends animal kingdom that came to her rescue and helped her make a beautiful ball gown.
She also had a fairy godmother that she never knew about who suddenly appeared and helped make everything right so that cinderella could go to the ball.
She had a beautiful gown.
She had a coach to ride in with footmen and everything that she needed.
The only stipulation was she hadta be home by midnight because everything would go back to what it had been before.
"So cinderella went to the ball , was having a wonderful time and forgot about the time until she heard the clock striking midnight."
She ran down the stairs to try to get away and in the process lost one of her slippers which was a beautiful glass slipper.
She did make it home on her own.
Noone ever found out.
But in the meantime the prince had become so smitten with this beautiful girl at the ball that he was determined to find out who lost their glass slipper on his staircase.
So he went door to door in the country with his helpers trying to find who foot would fit into this glass slipper.
Noone's had so far.
But when he came to the home of cinderella her two sisters of course hadta try it on.
They could not get their foot in there.
Cinderella happened to overhear and came out of hiding and tried on the slipper.
The prince had found his princess.
They got married and lived happily ever after.
Girl's cat went up a tree.
Her dad went up to get the cat.
The dad got stuck.
The fire department hadta come and get them both out.
You put it on a plate.
You take some peanut butter.
You take a knife.
You spread it onto one piece of bread.
You take out the jelly.
So there was a girl who got caught in a river.
Looks like she maybe fell in a river bebecause they are not taking boats or anything.
There is what looks like either a cop or a fireman.
He is got a harness to safety equipment to safety lines.
He is wearing a lifejacket.
He is trying to get out into the river to rescue the girl.
A kid was going to school.
His mother told him to take an umbrella.
He insisted he did not want to bring the umbrella.
He did not need it.
He went to school.
It started raining.
He got upset and came home and was soaking wet.
His mother was upset that she he did not listen to her.
He changed into dry clothes took the umbrella and left.
A kid was playing soccer.
He kicked his soccer ball through the window.
It hit a lamp.
The guy inside the house jumped up.
Looked out to see who kicked it.
There is a man who had a daughter named cinderella.
He married a new evil cruel woman who had two daughters of her own.
The father then died.
The girl was raised by her stepmother and her two cruel stepsisters.
Who made her do all the work and clean the house.
One day the king was yelling at his son about how he needed to get married.
Said he was going to throw a ball.
Order all the single women in the kingdom to come.
Cinderella and her sisters got the invitations.
Cinderella was not allowed to go.
Her sisters went.
She was forced to stay home.
The mice and the birds though felt sorry for her.
Bebecause they liked her.
So they came and made her a dress.
So she could go.
The sisters came home and found out about this and destroyed it.
Then they left to go to the ball.
Her fairy godmother came.
Told her she hadta be back til midnight.
Or everything went back to the way it was.
She went to the ball.
She met the prince.
The prince fell in love with her.
She realized it was midnight.
She hadta go.
She took off running.
The coach turned back into a pumpkin.
He sent the shoe to every woman in the kingdom to find out who it belonged to.
He eventually found out it belonged to cinderella.
They got married.
You cut two slices of bread from a fresh lohss of bread from the store.
You put some peanut butter on it.
You put some jelly on it.
You slap the two together.
Oh my looks like a family's having another picnic.
Boy they got a lot of picnics in this project do not they?
Anyways they went out to the country.
They are hanging out underneath the tree.
Let us call this cat lindsey.
Lindsey the cat climbs up the tree.
He is trying to kit the cat down.
Daddy climbs up the tree to get the cat.
Then the ladder falls down.
So fortunately someone has their cellphone.
They call the fire department.
The fire charten comes and gets the daddy down from the tree.
The little girl named molly she is really happy now.
They all go for ice cream and live happily ever after.
Well there was this little girl named cinderella who is like really cute little girl.
An but unfortunately her mother something nasty happened to her.
I think she went to the the rehab center in switzerland for like two years.
So cinderella hadta go move in with her evil stepmother.
And her evil stepmother had two other daughters.
The evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but did not like cinderella.
So this this evil stepmother makes cinderella do all the work around the house.
She is got to clean the floors and vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff.
So anyways you know the mom and the stepgirls they are kind of reading the mail.
They get an invitation to the ball where the prince is going to be there.
Where cinder really just has totally got the hots for this guy.
She knows what he looks like.
But the evil stepmother says.
No you are not getting a dress.
You know it is like you know.
You stay home.
You know clean the attic and stuff.
While me and your stepsisters we are going to go to the ball.
So shey go shopping.
They get a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelery and new shoes and everything.
They go out to get ready to go to the ball.
She is crying while they are all going away.
Wish i could go to the ball.
All of a sudden her fairy godmother appears.
Brunhilda the fairy godmother says.
Cinderella says.
I wish i could go to the ball bebecause i really like this prince guy.
I like to dance.
I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff.
But that evil stepmother of mine will not let me go.
So anyways there is the the the fairy godmother you know gets out the wand and touches cinderella.
All of a sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty gown ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking.
Then they go out in the garden.
They dig up a pumpkin.
She kind of does the pumpkin.
Then she turns the nasty oldd horse they have got in the barn into these really cool horses that pulls the carriage.
Bebecause you hafta pull up the castle in a carriage or they will not let you into the ball.
So anyways she gets into the pumpkin.
The fairy godmother even put some air freshener in there so it did not smell like a pumpkin.
They went to the ball.
They got to the castle.
An you know she is kind of hanging out with all the other pretty ladies.
You know the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters.
Even when they see her they do not even think it is her bebecause she is so pretty.
Anyways the prince comes in.
You know they have the dance.
They are all dancing around.
He sees cinderella kind of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says.
I do not know who you are.
He says.
Well would you like to dance?
She says.
Well i am i know how to dance but i would love to try.
But she does not really know that the fairy godmother put a spell on the shoes.
So anyone in the shoes can dance like magic.
"On top of that , the shoes will only fit cinderella."
Of course the prince falls in love with her.
You know they talk schmoozy things.
They are already talking about having kids.
You know kind of car should they get.
What is she going to to when she turns queen and stuff.
They are going to get married.
But then cinderella finally remembers that the fairy godmother warned her that all the stuff turns back to what it useta be at midnight.
Except for the shoes for some reason but they never told her that.
But the pumpkin turns into a pumpkin.
The horse turns into an ugly horse.
The dress turns into rags at midnight.
The clock starts chiming so they go running away.
Or she runs the downstairs.
She gets around the corner just in time when all her clothes turn to rags.
The prince is totally dumbfounded.
You got to marry one of these other two girls that are the daughter of the rich girl who cinderella does not like.
Because you know she is got lots of money.
The prince says.
I am going to go look for her.
So anyways he finds one one of her shoes.
Makes all the girls try it on.
He is a prince so he can make people do things like that you know.
So anyways he finds cinderella.
Actually cinderella does not answer the door the sisters do.
An they say.
Well we will try it on.
It turns out one sister wears a size fifteen.
The other sister has shoes so big that they hafta be custom made.
Then the stepmom even tries to try ththem on.
Course her feet have got big corns so she cannot try ththem on.
Then cinderella she is hiding in the back.
Kind of quivering while the you know this is all going on.
The prince sees her and says.
You look kind of like her except you look kind of dumpy today.
Looks like your dress is gone.
But why do not you try this on?
She comes out.
The stepmother says.
The prince says.
No she is trying it on or you are going to jail lady.
So cinderella tries the schipper on.
Then when she turns the slipper on.
This is me adlibbing.
But all of a sudden the dress comes back on.
The prince sees her.
They hug and kiss.
They get married in the cathedral in the big city.
They live happily ever after.
Okay let us well let us see if we can throw some humor into this tragedy here.
Oh it looks like two people that were going for a drive.
They saw a wash.
They decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it.
They can do these things.
Of course the four wheel drive got run over.
They got washed off the truck and into the flood.
Fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck.
So they grab that on.
It ooks like he is got that on.
She is holding on to him.
Hopefully the police are going to come and rescue ththem.
Or it could be that this guy's actually a fireman trying to rescue her.
She was the one that drove the truck into the wash.
You know maybe they are going to make it maybe they are not.
But well let us assume that they do.
They do make it.
They sheriff joe arrests them for five thousand dollar fine for doing the stupid driver law.
But after that they live happily ever after.
Okay it looks like.
Let us get a name for this stupid looking kid here.
Reginald decides he is going to go out to play.
So he goes out in the front garden.
He is playing with his football.
Soccer's what they call it in america.
He kicks it in the window of his neighbor.
Looks like the kid ran away.
So looks like the neighbor's really pissed off because it not only came through his window.
He is looking out the window to seeing if the kid is going to confess up to it or run away.
Well we just do not know what happened.
Whether that happened.
Let us assume the worst.
Let us say that the the guy spots the kid running away.
Let us get sheriff joe in this again.
The kid come.
Sheriff doe comes arrest hi am.
Well it looks like.
Oh let us get a name for this stupid looking little kid here.
Oh we will name him after my nephew eric.
Looks like eric is going to go to school.
His mom of course is saying.
You know what?
I think it is time that you take the umbrella.
Bebecause i am guessing it is going to rain out.
He says.
No mom i do not want the umbrella.
Anyways somehow he gets out of the house.
Mom forces him to take the umbrella.
But then he hides it underneath the the the car.
He goes off to school.
It starts raining.
So he kind of gets halfway to school.
Then he comes running home to mom crying because he is all wet.
Does not let him have.
You know she actually reaches into his backpack and takes out the brownie she would given him take for dessert at lunch and says.
No you cannot have any brownies you naughty little kid.
Makes him go back to school.
Poor eric then hasta go to school without any brownies because he did not listen to his mom.
Cat climbed a tree.
So the man climbed up the tree to help.
So that then the man could not come down.
So somebody call the fire department.
Fire department's going to rescue everybody.
Okay i guess the reason the man's up in the tree is bebecause the ladder fell down.
I put jelly on it.
Enjoy all the grease and sugar you should not have.
Oh the rescuer and a girl about to be rescued is trapped in some brush in a swift flood water.
That is what you call a swift water rescue.
The man in the flotation jacket is trying to rescue her.
It looks like they are both in trouble.
Well a boy has kicked soccer ball through a window.
The soccer ball nen it hits a lamp.
The man is getting out of his easy chair.
Holding the soccer ball to see where it came from.
I guess looking out the broken window.
Oh the boy wants to go out.
It is raining out.
So the mother's giving the boy an umbrella.
So the boy does not want de umbrella.
He does not think it is raining hard enough.
Then it starts raining harder.
He comes in.
Now he is went went to school again with a backpack on his back.
This time he is happy because he is got an umbrella.
That lived with her mother.
The nicest way i could say it.
Cinderella wanted to go out dancing.
But she did not have a way to get there i guess.
So her fairy godmother come to the rescue.
Presented her with a carriage pulled by white horses.
Where the prince was having a party.
But she hadta leave because her fairy godmother told her back home by midnight.
Or her carriage would turn into a pumpkin.
Well she had a beautiful time at the party.
When it was midnight she jumped out in her carriage.
It was taken home.
Shoon as she got there it was midnight.
Her carriage turned into a pumpkin.
So she went home.
But when she ran out of the palace she lost one of her slippers.
Some time later a knock on the door came.
Here was the prince come to try the slipper on her foot.
It would not fit her not so pretty sisters.
So so he wanted her as a bride.
So she proposed to her.
Her and the prince lived happily ever after.
Well at our house we take the bread out of the freezer.
Then on the other side of the toasted bread we take about a tablespoon of raspberry jam.
Smooth it clear across so it gets from side to side.
Then we smack ththem together.
If our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts.
But if we are going to eat it we eat it with the crust.
The dog and the cat were fighting.
The cat climbed up the tree.
The dog was chasing the cat but could not climb up the tree.
The little girl happened upon the scene.
Realized that the cat was in the tree and she is going to need her dad.
So she got her dad.
Her dad got the ladder.
They were trying to get the cat out of the tree.
But the ladder fell down.
But just in the nick of time the firemen who were called by the neighbors came.
Do you want us to be creative with it?
Well this could easily have happened in iowa.
The des moines river was rising in nineteen ninety three.
People were warned not to be near the river.
But people do that.
The water has an undertow.
It can catch the the little girl.
That could have happened in this picture.
Police and fire and safety people go to great lengths to help those people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Ah the little boy was playing ball.
Maybe he was playing soccer with his friends.
Instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it.
It went through the window.
Because he was sitting there.
It knocked over his lamp.
Then i am not sure what he is doing in the last picture.
But he is looking at the window.
The man is looking at the window.
It looks like he is holding something.
But maybe he is making a telephone call.
I do not know.
Well typically little boys and umbrellas do not really want to go together.
Because the little boy would be much happier if he does not hafta bother with an umbrella.
But his mother says.
You got to take an umbrella.
At the last minute he said.
No i am not going to take the umbrella.
He runs outside.
He goes back home.
He says to mom.
I guess i will take the umbrella.
Then he takes the umbrella and leaves.
There was a woman with two ugly girls.
They got married the the man and the woman.
The wicked stepmother with her two daughters made the little girl.
She worked and she scrubbed.
She had so many things to do all day long.
While the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do.
But one night there was a special party that the prince was giving.
Because you see these girls have grown up.
The prince was looking for a princess.
Well the two ugly stepsisters they were getting dresses.
They were going to get to go to the party.
But the poor little stepdasister who was the father's daughter was not going to get to go.
Two mice came and said to cinderella.
We are going to make it so you can go too.
Cinderella they did their magic.
Cinderella got a beautiful dress.
She got a carriage.
She took off for the dance.
She danced with the prince all night long.
But as the the mice had told her.
So at the stroke of midnight she realized she hadta leave.
So she ran.
She ran away.
She left her shoe.
The prince found her shoe.
Then she got back home.
The wicked stepsisters came back.
Then the prince was looking for the owner of the shoe.
So he went out all across the village and the land looking for it.
They came to cinderella's house.
At cinderella's house the wicked stepsisters were thrust to the front.
They tried and tried to wear the shoe.
But cinderella was not given the chance until at the last they saw cinderella.
The shoe fit perfectly.
Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the first thing you hafta do is go to the freezer and get the bread out of the freezer.
You keep the bread in the freezer because that way it does not dry out.
If there is only two of you in the house you do not go through a loaf of bread a day so it is important to keep it fresh.
So you keep the bread in the freezer.
So ya go to the freezer.
You never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter because it just slides around and it is really difficult to work with.
You will find that because the bread is frozen it is easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly.
After you have spread the peanut butter and the jelly slap the two sides together.
You can cut on the diagonal.
You can cut cross wise.
You can cut vertical.
You can cut ththem into as many pieces as you want.
If you have a five year oldd grandson you cut ththem into about eight pieces.
After you have cut it well you got to put the peanut butter back in the cupboard.
We have a crisis on our hands folks.
If this was the evening news it would be reported by one of those talking heads that is very serious about everything.
We have a cat that is up in the tree and the cat belongs to a little girl.
Dad who is gone up in the tree to try to get the cat down climbed up on the ladder.
Something happened.
The ladder fell down.
Now we have got the cat and the dad up in the tree.
The dog is helping by standing at the bottom tree barking a lot.
Noise always helps.
Somher other the firemen found out about it and they have come.
They have got a ladder.
They are going to come over.
They will probably get the cat out of the tree too.
The dog will stop barking.
Arizona has this thing they call what is the.
Anyway the law basically says if you drive into a gully or a wash after it is rained and your car becomes stranded you got to pay to have somebody come and pull you out.
We have a situation here where a girl has someher or other gotten too close to a moving stream.
There is a lot of water.
There is a lot of water moving.
It is moving rapidly.
She is been washed downstream.
She is gotten to a branch that is sticking up out of the water.
She is managed to hang on there for a minute.
One of the guys paramedics or firemen threw on lifejacket.
He is jumped in.
He is gotten to where she is.
He is going to get a hold of her.
They are going to get her out okay.
Probably since it is a young girl it was probably an accident that she fell in.
We are lucky that she got to the point where she could grab a hold of something.
Somebody would know where she is and get the paramedics called.
They could get there and rescue her.
So yeah i predict they are going to rescue her.
They are both going to be on the evening news.
He is going to get an award.
Here is a nice young boy who is out playing soccer.
He is practicing because he wants to get ready for the soccer game.
He kicks the ball in the wrong direction as sometimes happens.
Smacks through the window and gets into the living room where there is this really mean guy who lives in this house.
The soccer ball comes crashing through the window.
Breaks the lamp when it hits the floor.
The guy picks up the soccer ball goes over looks out the window and says.
Kid you are not getting this back.
I am teaching you a lesson.
You will never do this again to somebody else.
Must be the grinch who scole christmas.
Little tommy's getting ready to head off for school.
Mom says.
It might rain today tommy.
You better take an umbrella.
Tommy says.
I do not want an umbrella.
I do not want one.
I am leaving.
I do not need an umbrella.
Tommy gets part way to school and guess what happens?
Of course it starts sprinkling.
Now any normal kid would just go ahead and walk to school.
Tommy turns around and comes running back to the house.
See kids smarter they just go on to school.
Then they dry out.
It stops raining by the time it gets time to come home.
But tommy went back.
She is in this “i told you so” mood.
So she gives him the umbrella.
Tommy puts up the umbrella.
Cinderella and her two sisters lived in this nice little house.
But they pick on her and give her a bad time.
They will not let her do the things that she would like to do.
The kingdom is having a big fancy ball.
Family gets an invitation to come to the ball.
They want to go.
They want to get dressed up and go.
But they do not want cinderella to go.
So they will not let her get dressed up they put on their fancy clothes.
Family does not have a whole lot of this stuff.
There is not enough to go around for the three three kids.
But the two sisters take off.
They go to the ball.
The fairy godmother comes along and says.
What is going on?
She just like.
I would really like to go to the ball.
The fairy godmother says.
Gives her a nice coach to ride in.
Gives her a fancy dress to wear.
She goes to the fancy ball.
She meets prince charming.
Prince charming likes her better than the two ugly sisters.
The two ugly sisters are kind of miffed about the whole thing.
Prince charming and cinderella are having a wonderful time.
Suddenly cinderella remembers that this spell that the fairy godmother cast is only good until midnight.
As the clock is striking midnight she hasta run away from the prince before he finds out that she is really just this poor girl from the other side of the tracks.
But as she is running away one of the glass slippers comes off.
So the prince follows up on this.
He spends the next several days going about the kingdom trying to find somebody whose foot will fit into this little slipper.
The two sisters try it on.
He finally finds cinderella.
The sisters say.
Cinderella tries it.
Of course it fits.
Prince charming has found his cinderella.
They get married.
You often hear about.
A cat gets stuck up in the tree.
The little girl has tried to get the cat to come down.
The dog barking at the base of the tree is not helping anything.
Then the father got involved.
He said.
I can climb up and get the cat for you.
But he got up in the tree.
The branch started to wiggle and wobble.
He got scared.
So the mother looking out of a window in the house probably called the fire truck to come and get the cat.
I would say it is a picture of a young lady being rescued from a flood waters.
Well i could make it up i guess.
He used an overhanging limb to reach out to her.
But she is hanging tight to his muscled arm.
I think he will bring her ashore.
But he does not have very good aim.
He might have wanted to do it.
It breaks.
It goes into the house.
The man that is in the room where the ball comes in stands up.
Oh boy that kid better run fast.
Looks like a child is going off to school.
The mother says.
It is going to rain.
You need an umbrella.
Oh bye mom i do not need an umbrella.
Well he does not get very far before it starts.
He is getting wet.
But she dries him off.
Off he goes happy and content.
In this kingdom there was a family who a mother died.
They had one child called cinderella.
Father remarried and the stepmother had two daughters.
Cinderella came to live with them.
To make one family out of two when the husband remarried.
Well it was not working too well.
The stepdaughters and stepmother did not like cinderella.
They treated her like a maid.
She hadta do all the work.
One day a letter came in the mail announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom so that the prince could find a suitable wife.
Well you can imagine how much excitement this called.
The stepdaughters started thinking about.
What will i wear?
Cinderella went up and found an dress in a chest that held her belongings.
She came down.
Was starting to work on making this dress fit her.
The step daughters looked at her and they said.
Well you are not going.
You are not the kind of person that could go to this ball and be the prince's wife.
They even tore the scarf off of her dress the waistband.
It made the cinderella very very sad.
She did not know what to do.
But she went outside and was crying.
The a fairy appeared to her.
It turned out to be her fairy godmother that she had not known anything about.
The godmother said.
I will arrange for you to get to the ball.
So the day of the ball came.
The stepmother and stepdaughters went off in their fancy clothes in a fancy horse and carriage.
The godmother did her magic.
She turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage.
She turned mice into horses.
She used her magic powers and her wand to dress cinderella in a beautiful ball ground.
See saw that cinderella got into the carriage.
Cinderella entered the ballroom.
Everyone turned to look at her because of her beauty and her graciousness.
The prince noticed her.
Cinderella was having such a good time she did not think a thing about time.
She heard the clock start to strike midnight.
She did get out of the palace and the palace grounds before the clocks had its last stroke.
The magic was gone.
But the prince found a silver slipper that he knew had been on his loved one's feet.
So he thought.
Well i will make a match.
I will go around the kingdom and i can certainly find the person whose foot fits in this.
So he did that.
When he got to cinderella's house the stepdaughters tried to cram their feet into the shoe.
But it did not fit.
Cinderella was peeking around the corner.
Stepmother and daughters did not acknowledge her.
But the prince saw her and said.
Oh would you try on this shoe?
Cinderella had loved the prince too.
So they got married and lived happily ever after.
An you open the jar of peanut butter.
An with a knife you spread it on one piece of bread.
Then you open the jar of jelly.
You spread that on the other piece of bread.
Then you put the two pieces of bread together.
The little girl is upset and asked her daddy to get the kitty who had climbed up and gotten stuck in the tree.
Dad is also stuck in the tree.
The dog is at the base of the tree barking.
In the background the firemen are coming with a ladder to rescue the cat and the dad.
The woman has been swooshed into the water.
She is definitely having a problem.
There is a rescuer there.
He is got the rigging to hold on to her and pull her out.
He looks well equipped.
He looks very very strong.
He pulls her out of the swirling waters and gives her a big kiss.
He kicks his soccer ball through a window.
"The soccer ball enters the living room, knocks over the lamp and surprises a man."
The man grabs the ball and looks out the window.
Decides what he is going to do next.
He says he does not want to take an umbrella.
So mom let us him go.
It begins to rain.
It rains harder.
He rushes home.
He is sopping wet.
He goes out again with the umbrella.
Cinderella is introduced to her stepsisters and her stepmother.
It seems to be a family of blending.
So we have lovely little cinderella who was given terrible jobs.
She is cleaning.
Her ugly sisters get to have a good time with beautiful clothes.
Cinderella has all the menial tasks around the house.
The little mice in the house seem to be her friends and they help her.
One day someone came to the castle and said.
There is going to be a party.
Of course the stepsisters were invited.
Cinderella in her torn dress really wanted to go.
Suddenly her fairy godmother appeared and said.
Would you like this beautiful dress?
Cinderella said.
So the fairy godmother touched her with a wand.
At the ball she danced with the prince.
The clock struck twelve.
Everything returned as it was.
Her beautiful carriage had turned into a pumpkin.
She lost her glass slipper bebecause she left the ball.
Later on the prince came by saying whoever belonged to that glass slipper would be his bride.
He tried it on cinderella.
It fit her.
It did not fit her ugly stepsisters.
So she got to marry the prince.
She has her tricycle.
She is holding her hands up to a tree.
She is begging the cat to come down.
But then her father must have come to see if he could help.
He had a ladder.
But he did not take the ladder.
He just climbed up the tree because he saw a heavy branch.
But he is stuck there now because he cannot get to him otherwise that branch will break.
Then he will hurt himself.
In the meantime the little girl's dog comes.
He is barking and barking.
What are you doing up there?
I cannot come up there.
Another bird is taking this all in.
But he is singing.
But lo and behold we see two firemen with a large ladder.
Running toward the man because they are going to get the man out.
So they are parked.
They are going in the back.
Not the what he tried to do by himself.
The girl will get her cat back.
Because the firemen are going to get the cat down.
He will just stay there.
Because he is not going to be bothered.
They they stick to a place if they like it.
The little dog will stop barking and go home with the girl.
Or maybe when she goes on her tricycle she is going to go home with the cat.
The dog will follow.
First i need whole wheat bread.
There is a special bread that i like.
It is called seventeen grain bread.
So i get the bread.
I will get two slices.
I get peanut butter.
I like it with the nuts in it.
So i whoosh whoosh that around my butter spoon.
I spread it very easily on both pieces.
Then i have some jelly on the side.
It could be raspberry or strawberry whatever i happen to have.
I will say raspberry.
Then i just put it over it very gently so the sandwich will stick nice.
Then i cover it over.
I cut it in four pieces.
I hold a one piece at a time.
I know i enjoy that type of sandwich.
It looks like a a tree.
But he is got a lot of gear on.
Okay i will start.
I am taking this as water.
Although i did not know how.
It capsized.
Where there was branches that was extended from the trees.
He has muscles.
He is holding on to this limb that is over from the land.
The water is still circling around them.
There is a woman next to him.
He is holding on.
You can see his muscles are all tense.
He is got all the equipment.
But the lady does not look like she has any real gear to help her.
There is some kind of thing sticking out from his arm.
As if he is going to give her that to put on.
Then she is trying to see where she can hold on to him.
He says.
You can do it.
That is how they are securing themselves.
Then he pulls her slowly out of the water with this piece that might have helped her to to be strengthen or to be tied to him.
Because he was so strong and the way he had his you know equipment here not to drown.
So the beginning is watch the waters.
If you see it bad do not go into them.
If you capsize do not panic.
Do you know what that is that picture?
That is why i said the tree was you know coming from land.
He is playing out in a backyard.
He is kicking it looks like a what they call a soccer ball.
You know one of these soccer balls.
He is kicking it.
Uhoh but what happens is he goes through a window.
He gets scared bebecause he sees this soccer ball coming at hi am.
He gets up very carefully because there is glass now on the floor.
He picks up the soccer ball.
He looks outside the broken window to see where it came from or who was there.
He sees his son had kicked it in there.
Now he hasta determine what is he going to do.
First of all he knows he knows he is going to see if the boy is alright.
He is got to find someone to fix the window.
Then he is going to tell the boy not to kick the ball near a window or something like that.
He is teaching him a lesson.
But he did not get excited because accidents like that can happen.
So he just teaches the boy.
I am glad you are not hurt.
The glass ca be fixed.
We will clean up here.
Get that all straightened out.
There is you know i worked for the new york telephone company.
There was one thing that i still remember to this day.
There is no job that is so important that it cannot be performed safely at all times.
This is what this man told this boy.
Because he remembered he useta work for the telephone company.
He says.
Now i am going to tell him safety.
Apparently it is raining outside.
So the mother says.
The boy says.
Oh mom i do not need it.
You you you you keep the umbrella.
It is not going to rain.
But it looks like it is raining.
But he goes out.
He no sooner goes out than big drops of rain come down on him.
He is getting all excited now.
He is covered with rain.
He comes back to his mother dripping wet.
His mother looks at him very sternly.
Now have you learned your lesson?
You listen to your mother?
He says.
Alright let me have the umbrella.
So he takes the umbrella.
He is going back to where he was going from.
I guess he was going to school.
But now he knows he should listen to his mother.
That is the lesson that he learned.
He says.
Rain or shine i am going to listen to my mother.
Well once upon a time there was this woman that had two of her daughters.
She did all the work for them.
But the other two were spoiled brats.
Because they did not have anything to do with her.
They thought they were something special.
Whenever she would come in with some tea.
Some tea she would bring it to them.
They would make fun of her.
Bebecause she was not dressed like they were.
Then they did not even want it because they did not feel like having it then.
So they would complain.
According to the pictures that i sorta remember little animals.
She liked the mice.
She liked the horse.
She liked the dog.
She found peace with them.
She got along with them.
Finally there was one time that someone brought her a dress.
Was relative i guess.
She tried it on she looked very pretty.
They did not want her to have that dress.
She looked lovely.
But they did not want to admit it.
So the stepmother looked at her as if to say.
I have to watch you.
But then they took the dress away.
Then by and by they hear that they are going to have a big ball at this palace.
They got some kind of written notice on it.
The three of them heard it together.
The little girl that was mistreated and the two stepsisters.
They all heard.
So she says.
Okay we are going to get you dressed up in the most beautiful dresses and make sure that you get the prize.
Because i understand that he is looking for a woman.
So they the she the the mother gets the two stepdaughters dressed up as best she could.
She looks through a some of the things that were there.
She finds a little book with a picture.
She says.
They can hear her.
She says.
That be nice.
I would like to have that dress.
They make it for her.
They make it for her.
So she puts it on.
She looks beautiful.
She has beads.
She has a sash.
Well that that whats what what they showed.
Then when the time came that they were to go she came down.
Because they were dressed up so she was dressed up now in this dress.
They looked at her.
She did look beautiful in it.
But they tore the beads off.
You are not going to that party.
Because we look better.
We will win.
The mother is going right along with everything.
So she says.
You go to your room and take care of what you hafta.
So she goes back in her room.
Her fairy godmother comes along.
Cinderella why are you crying?
She says.
Because i wanted to go to the party.
But they took my dress off.
They they said i could not go.
I will see that you go.
I will see that you get everything that you need.
So the the fairy godmother gets her a beautiful white dress.
She dresses her up.
Now she says.
I will get you a coach.
She gets her a coach and brings her there palace that she has seen from her window.
Then all the people are dancing.
But she she is standing out.
So as she comes in everyone takes second looks at her.
He falls in love with her immediately.
So he dances with her throughout the evening.
Then she looks at the clock and she says.
Ooh i have got to go back.
Because fairy godmother says i will turn into you know the way i was.
I do not want him to see me that way.
So she goes back into her coach.
As she is running her slipper falls off.
One of the men pick it up and show it to the prince.
He says.
Well we got to find out who that slipper belongs to because that is the one i want to marry.
So she is comes home.
She has the other slipper so she is looking at it.
They are just reminiscing at what she had gone through.
He is going to every door to look for this woman that owns this slipper.
They she they try it on the two sisters.
They are pinching and squeezing and trying to get into the shoe.
They could not get it on.
The mother is very upset because she wanted one of her daughters to fit into that slipper.
But then they said.
Do you have any other children?
Then she comes along.
In her little outfit that she wears in the house.
Immediately he sits her down.
She puts her foot in.
She fits into it like a glove.
She says.
That is the one i want.
That she is coming back with me.
The prince wants her.
But she goes back.
The animals are very happy that she takes pardon.
As the story goes the prince fall falls in love with her.
He has already fell in love with her.
But he marries her.
She and the prince live happily ever after.
That is the way the fairy godmother helped this little cinderella.
Toast the bread first if you would like.
You can use the same knife or a different knife for the jelly.
Okay there was a little girl out playing with her cat one day.
The cat saw the bird up in the tree and decided to chase it up there.
Uhoh but now the cat is stuck.
The little girl does not know how to get it down.
A man is walking by with his dog.
She asks him if he can help get her cat out of the tree.
He says.
He cannot resist the little girl.
He says.
Yes i will help get your cat down.
He climbs up the tree.
The dog does not like his owner up the tree.
So he is barking wildly.
Well now the man is stuck in the tree.
So the next passerby calls the fire department to try to get them all down.
The fire department comes.
They get down the man and the cat.
The bird continues to happily sing.
Okay this little girl lived in a town.
She lived near a creek.
Because it was springtime there was a lot of rains.
The creek near her house flooded.
She went over to look at it but slipped in.
Luckily enough she got caught by a branch that she could hang on to.
There was a lot of people around.
Somebody called for help.
The fireman did go in to save her.
Okay there is a young boy outside playing soccer.
In it goes.
After it hits the lamp.
Dad goes over and says.
Okay guess we will hafta get it fixed now.
The little boy's getting ready to go to school.
The mother says.
You better take your umbrella.
But look mom it is not raining.
I am not taking an umbrella.
I will look dumb.
Out he goes.
He gets halfway to school.
It starts to sprinkle.
Now it is starting to rain really hard.
I better go home and get the umbrella.
He gets home and mom says.
What did i tell you?
You shoulda taken the umbrella.
So he dries off.
Once upon a time there was a family.
There was three daughters in the family.
The father in the family left died went away somehow.
Then she had her own daughters.
Well of course she never liked the stepdaughter.
So as they were growing up the stepdaughter which of course was cinderella was the one that always hadta clean the house scrub the floors take care of the other two daughters etcetera etcetera.
So she lived life this way.
They grew up.
The king and queen decided to have a ball in their town.
So that the prince could meet all the lovely young ladies in the town.
Well of course cinderella wanted to go too.
But she had no beautiful clothes to wear.
Was afraid that her stepmother would not even let her go.
Well she decided that she was just going to pretend that she was going to the ball.
So she made herself a beautiful dress up in the attic.
Decided well maybe she could go to the ball after all.
She would after all made herself a dress.
They said.
Oh look you cannot go in that ugly dress.
They tore off all the ribbons and sequins and pretty buttons.
Then of course cinderella cried.
The two stepsisters went off to the ball.
While cinderella was crying her fairy godmother shows up.
The fairy godmother says.
Cinderella why are you crying?
You can go to the ball.
She makes cinderella a beautiful new dress.
She makes the mice into horses.
They can all transport cinderella magically to the ball.
Well cinderella gets to the ball only to be reminded by the fairy godmother that she must leave by the stroke of midnight.
Because everything is going to turn back into the mice and the pumpkin.
She will be stuck.
So cinderella goes to the ball.
Nobody knows who this lovely young woman is.
He dances with her all night.
So they dance all night.
The prince just falls in love with her.
Cinderella notices.
The clock is striking twelve.
I hafta go.
No no the night has just begun!
No no i hafta go.
So she runs down the stairs.
She is going to meet her pumpkin coach to take her home.
But as she is running down the stairs she loses a shoe.
Well she has no time to go back for it.
So she leaves it there.
The prince chases her.
So he he decides.
The only way i am going to find her is to find out which young lady in my kingdom fits this glass slipper.
So he goes into the kingdom over the next several days trying the glass slipper on every young woman he can.
Finally they get to cinderella's house.
He tries the slipper on the stepmother.
No it does not fit you.
He tries it on the oldest stepsister.
Oh my goodness i can only fit it on your big toe.
He tries it on the next stepsister.
Are you sure there is no other women in your house?
Well we have our little slave girl.
But you know she was not at the ball.
Alright well come on let us try it anyway.
So cinderella comes out.
Lo and behold it fits just perfectly.
The prince looks.
So he takes her home.
They live happily ever after.
The dad tried to get the cat out of the tree.
But he does not look like he was successful.
His ladder fell down.
The little girl's standing under the cat crying.
The firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder.
There is also a bird in the tree.
Well you take two slices of bread.
You put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other one.
You put them together.
That makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
It is a picture of two people stuck in a flood.
He is hanging on for dear life to a.
But he also seems to be wearing a lifevest.
I see nothing like that on her.
So i guess he is in there to rescue her.
Yeah i think that is about all i can tell you.
I wouldn want to be either one of ththem thank you.
The little boy is kicking a soccer ball around.
It goes through somebody is window.
Into a room where it knocks a lamp down.
There is a man sitting.
He gets up and takes the ball and the window.
I do not really see there is an end to that story.
He winds up with the ball.
But i am sure it did not end there.
That is about the best i can tell you on that one.
Little boy's going out the door with his backpack.
Apparently he is going to school or something.
Mother wants him to take an umbrella.
He tells her.
It is not going to rain.
He does not want an umbrella.
He goes out.
Pretty soon it is raining.
He goes running home through the puddles with his hands trying to keep the water off his head.
She is standing there waiting for him bebecause she knew he would be back or drown one or the other.
He goes off again with an umbrella.
A man has a daughter.
Marries a woman who has two daughters.
But he must travel a lot bebecause he is never around in the rest of the story.
The stepmother does not like the the stepdaughter.
She is the one that hasta clean and wait on them.
And they are her friends bebecause she really has no other friends.
The meanwhile at the castle the king decides he is going to throw a ball for the prince because the prince should get married.
He is not showing any signs of being interested in anybody.
So they put out the word that there is going to be a ball.
They send out invitations.
The stepmother gets the invitation and sets to making ready her two daughters.
Cinderella who they do not even consider as part of the family goes into the trunks of things that probably were her mother's.
Which they totally destroy and tell her she is going nowhere.
And she cries.
Her fairy godmother comes.
But tells her that she hasta be home before midnight.
So she goes to the ball.
Of course the prince falls in love at first sight.
While stepmama and stepdaughters are just do not know what to do with themselves.
At five to twelve all of a sudden cinderella realizes she better get home.
As she runs away loses one of her glass slippers.
Goes home and everything disappears.
All she has left is the other glass slipper.
He decides he hasta find her.
So he sends this one of his people out to find her with the slipper.
They everybody in the realm hasta try this slipper on.
Of course it does not fit anybody because obvious she she had very tiny feet.
Finally they find her.
She tries the slipper on.
The prince marries her.
They live happily ever after.
An lay it a plate.
I put butter on my bread and then the peanut butter.
It looks like the dog might have chased the cat up there.
Either that or he is wants his the man to come down.
It looks like the ladder fell down that he climbed the tree up.
The firemen are coming here to rescue probably both the cat and the man.
The little girl wants her kitty back down.
Looks like the girl had fallen into maybe a raging river or something.
The rescue person was hanging on to a tree limb.
Bebecause he is got a life jacket.
It does not look like she does.
So he is gone out to rescue her.
They will probly make it.
He looks very strong.
A little boy is playing with his ball.
He is kicking it.
It looks like it might be a volleyball.
It is not a basketball bebecause you do not kick a basketball.
He went at the neighbor's probably yard or maybe his dad's.
It landed on either the neighbor or his father's lap lamp.
If it is dad or the neighbor either one is not going to be very happy with this little boy.
Mom wants the kid to take a umbrella with him.
I don want to take an umbrella.
You can just not take the umbrella.
He gets caught in the rain.
He runs back home and saying.
I would i shoulda taken the umbrella.
Now i am taking the umbrella.
Mom can say.
I told you so.
Cinderella's father marries this lady that has two two children.
As they grow up they do not get very nice.
She is relevated to not not comfortable quarters.
Then the prince is going to have a ball.
She everybody's all the eligible young ladies are invited because he is sposta pick a wife.
So she is not allowed to go.
She thinks she is sposta go too.
But they will not let her.
So they all go off to the ball.
She has a fairy godmother that comes an decks her all out in a coach and beautiful gown and etcetera.
She goes.
She dances.
Otherwise everything turns back into what it was before.
She loses a slipper as she leaves.
Because she would been dancing with the prince and they were just getting along great.
An they will he finds her slipper.
He looks all over the kingdom for this beautiful young lady that wears this slipper.
He tries all the the women kingdom try the the slipper on.
Nothing fits until he finds cinderella.
They live happily ever after.
To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients.
That would include two slices of bread.
Or one slice that you would fold in half.
Let us assume that you have two slices of bread.
You then hafta make a decision as to whether or not you are going to put butter on it.
Some people prefer to put the peanut butter on the bread first because they do not like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth.
So trying to satisfy as many people as possible we are going to take a knife.
We will spread the peanut butter on the bread.
Depending upon how much you want to fill the bread.
Then we will put the jelly on top of the peanut butter.
You are finished.
Little jeanie came crying to her father.
She said.
I am afraid that she will never come down.
She cannot come down.
So daddy being hero type went and got his ladder.
He climbed up the tree.
Just as he stepped off the ladder the ladder gave way and fell down.
They did not know what to do.
But the little girl remembered what she had learned at kindergarten.
If there is a big big problem all you needta do is to push nineoneone on the telephone.
So she ran in the house.
My daddy is up on top of the tree and he cannot come down along with cat.
The the nineoneone operator said.
Well she was just out there talking for just a minute when she heard the siren.
A fire big fire truck pulled up in front of her house.
Those wonderful firemen who not only put out fires.
But they help kids and dads and cats and everyone.
They put the ladder up against the tree.
This story takes place in arizona.
In which one of arizona's drivers did not heed the warning signs about.
Found that her car was quickly filling up with water.
That the motor had conked out.
That the the car was actually being pushed off the road.
She was eventually forced to crawl out the window and crawl up to the top of the car.
She did have her cellphone with her.
The sheriff's department dispatched both their helicopter and the paramedics and rescue squad crew.
The the car eventually from the force great force of the water was tipped over onto its side.
And the lady in distress was washed down the fast flowing stream.
Where she caught on to a branch.
Which was hovering overhead.
Her life was saved.
Even though she put the paramedics into great danger.
The car was lost.
She paid her ten thousand dollar fine for dispatching the helicopter.
Which he had just gotten for his birthday.
He was practicing kicking it.
When the ball slipped off the side of his foot and went right through the picture window of his neighbor's house.
But he knew about the skill and he knew that accidents happen.
So instead of you know dragging billy home to see his parents and to demand payment for his window he just told him.
You know i think what we needta do is to be able to fix your directional kicking.
So they went to the playground.
The coach soccer gave some direction to the ball player.
It all turned out well.
A mother was reminding her son that it was.
The weather forecast looked like it was going to be rain today.
She handed her son an umbrella.
He said.
It will not rain today.
I do not want to.
And i do not want to have my friends laughing at me for carrying an umbrella.
So off he went to school with his backpack on.
He got halfway there almost when it started to pour rain.
He did not want to go to school.
He did not want to face his mom.
So he hadta choose between two bad choices.
He returned home.
Where he changed clothes.
Mom handed him his umbrella.
Off he went to school.
Man and a woman got married.
The woman had two young girls by her first marriage.
The man had a little girl by his first marriage.
So they combined their families.
They ordered her around.
So she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her new stepsisters or siblings.
The girls grew up and to become young ladies.
With cinderella virtually becoming the the personal servant of her two stepsisters.
In the land that they lived there was a a king.
Who who had a son.
Who would take his place.
They needed to socialize.
Decided that they would have a ball.
In which they would invite all the young eligible young ladies in the kingdom to come and to enjoy a a marvelous ball at the royal palace.
The invitation came in the mail.
The two stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to go to the ball and dance and maybe find the the young prince to be of interest.
But they planned and schemed that cinderella would not be allowed to attend and and was excluded.
When it came time to leave for the ball cinderella was left behind.
Who knowing the inherent goodness in cinderella.
Said that she was going to make a very special evening for cinderella.
Provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin.
Told her that she wud going to go to the ball.
Which she did but that she hadta leave.
At which time she would be restored to her her normal self.
So cinderella went to the ball.
Who was captivated by her.
The prince and cinderella danced and danced.
Until almost the stroke of twelve when cinderella remembered that she hadta back into her pumpkin coach.
But in her haste one of her slippers that was made of glass or something would had fallen off.
She returned home.
Commanded his his helpers to search throughout the realm for a young lady that is foot would fit in that slipper.
So the helper looked throughout the realm.
Eventually came to the house where cinderella lived with her two stepsisters.
Try as they may the stepsisters could not put their large feet into the glass slipper.
But the the attendant tried the glass slipper on cinderella.
Cinderella's foot fit perfectly.
So the attendant knew that cinderella was the the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball.
Well you have got to get the bread someplace.
Then you place the bread on the table or wherever you want to put it.
You take one slice and put the peanut butter on the bread.
Then you go to the other slice of bread and you put the jelly on it.
Then you fold them together and enjoy.
I do not know what he is doing up there.
That dog must have chased him up there.
As he did the cat.
The girl got off her bike to try to save the cat.
Looks like the man went up there on a ladder to save the cat.
The ladder fell down.
I do not know how it fell down but it fell down somehow.
Now the fireman's coming over.
In order to get the guy down from the tree.
The bird's still singing there.
That seems about the entirety of the story.
I do not see any more to talk about.
There is a fire engine there too.
This picture it appears to be a fireman or somebody of a rescue nature.
In what appears to be a creek or a river.
Especially fast moving water.
The gentleman i say gentleman because he is all muscular and looks like he is got a moustache.
Which is either coming up out of the water.
It looks as though it is coming out of the water.
So the girl must have some how caught on to the tree branch.
He has a a leather belt which he i presume he is going to put around her.
Maybe a helicopter or a another set of rescue people will pull her in from the precarious area she is located at now.
Looks like everything's going to turn out okay.
The beginning of the story is a picture of a boy kicking a volleyball.
He seems to be having a good time.
But negligent in the fact that he does not know where he is kicking it.
Now he is kicked it into the window of a home.
By some reason he is kicked it through the window.
The ball has knocked the lamp off the table.
There is also there is stuff laying on the floor.
The man now gets up.
Looks out the window which yeah he is closer so the hole will look open more.
He is got the ball in his hand looking out who to blame or seeing where it came from.
Hopefully the the story ends good where realizes he was a kid one time.
This looks like a story between a a mother and a child.
The mother is warning the kid to take an umbrella.
Because it is raining outside.
He will need it.
The kid as most kids are says.
No i do not need it.
It is not going to rain.
As he goes outside it starts raining.
I do not know how far he got but it looks like he got pretty far.
Because now there is water all over the ground where he is walking.
Looks like his head's getting wet and everything else.
So finally he hasta go in and face mother.
Mother looks very upset with hi am.
He gets the umbrella.
Goes back outside and continues on his journey wherever he was going.
The story opens up with the mother of the two sisters and cinderella.
It looks to be a charge or whatever you call ththem guys.
The dog is sitting beside cinderella.
Now the basis of the story is the two evil sisters and the mother are planning or plotting against cinderella.
Sends out notices that a a party's going to be held.
So that he can find this princess that he wants to marry.
Meanwhile cinderella gets her dress out.
The stepmother seems to be enjoyed enjoying the whole thing.
After that the cinderella looks at the castle.
Oh no that was before she was dreaming about meeting some prince charming.
Now she has no dress or nothing to go to the ball with.
In pops the good fairy or mother or whatever you call ththem queen.
I forgot about that part of the story.
The dog and the horse guys or charges whatever you want to call them guys.
The mice into the horses that will pull cinderella to the ball.
They all get to the ball.
The prince takes fancy to cinderella over the rest of them.
Cinderella was told that that everything would turn into back the way it was at the stroke of midnight.
As the princess prince is trying to get to know cinderella better.
Cinderella says.
It is time to get out of here.
In her haste and running she drops her glass slipper.
She gets back to where she she began.
Everything turns back into way it was.
The prince despondent that the girl ran away tells his servants to find the girl with the glass slipper.
Announcements were sent all over the land to try on the glass slipper.
The two sisters tried on the slipper.
It did not fit.
Eventually cinderella tried on the slipper and she was known to be the one that the prince was dancing with.
An the prince and cinderella and the mice and everything else lived happily ever after.
I would take two pieces of white bread.
I get out the peanut butter jar.
It hasta be cold jelly.
Okay this looks like a lady had fallen into some water.
That put her into some flooding.
Where she was washed away from her home or fell off of a cliff or something.
A gentleman with a waterproof vest is hanging on a tree or in some kind of harness to try and rescue her.
To get her to grab onto the same thing.
Looks like he has a belt around himself.
But i cannot tell if she has a belt around her or not.
There is rushing water all around them.
A child was playing soccer or kickball.
It landed in a living room perhaps.
Where a gentleman was sitting.
The lamp was knocked down.
The gentleman picked the ball up and was looking out the where the ball shattered the window.
To see who did the damage.
Mom is offering the child with a backpack an umbrella.
Looks like he is leaving for school.
He is waving it off.
The young boy says.
He should take this umbrella.
The little boy with the backpack walking is running into some rain.
Let me run home.
It is raining pretty hard.
There is puddles.
He is trying to cover his head.
He gets home.
The little boy takes the umbrella and is off to school or wherever he was headed.
A lady comes into the house.
The gentleman greets the lady with her two daughters.
The lady is holding a cass.
The man has his daughter to his side.
She is curtseying with the dog laying there.
The next picture shows two grown sisters stepsisters maybe.
With cinderella blonde carrying a tray.
Cinderella was looking forward to going.
Cinderella got to the ball.
The mother and her girls were standing there.
The girls took part of cinderella's dress.
A ribbon off crisscross cross your heart.
Then she met with a lady.
That had a magic wand.
There was a gentleman with a whitish color pumpkin.
Three or four horses that were not acting normal.
She was giving cinderella a white dress to take to this ball.
Cinderella had this white dress on.
She was dancing with the prince.
She noticed the time was close to twelve of the clock.
She hadta run.
In the middle of her running she lost a glass slipper.
A gentleman was calling out to her about the slipper.
She continued to go back.
A gentleman came to the house.
The stepmother or whatever she was used her cane to trip the gentleman.
Another gentleman came and was trying the slipper on.
The mother or stepmother and the two girls were shocked when the glass slipper fit.
The two mice at the end were dressed up in some kind of drum major majorette costume.
Okay we have a little girl looks like who is cat climbed up on the tree.
The father who climbed into tree on a ladder to retrieve the cat.
The ladder fell down.
So they hadta call the fire department.
In the meantime the dog is barking at the father or the cat.
The little girl is calling to the cat on the branch to come down.
Which she rode a tricycle to get to.
That is about it that i can think.
You take two pieces of bread or two slices of bread.
You get a jar of peanut butter.
You spread one side of each slice of bread with the peanut butter.
Then you take a jar of jam.
You take a spoon.
You take it and you spread the jam slice of bread.
Then you close the two slices of bread together.
Then you can cut it in half or do what you want or eat it.
Poor little kitty ran up the tree.
I see the girl the sister oh was crying.
What should i do?
She calls for her farther to climb the tree to help get the kitty.
Dog is barking because he is worried about the father.
I donno if he is worried about the cat.
They are all worried that the kitty is not going to be saved.
So someone called the fire department who came to their rescue.
I hope everything is going to be fine.
They would get the kitty down.
An the father would hafta jump down.
How come the father didn use the ladder to get the kitty down himself instead of climbing up the tree?
We will see if the kitty is going to be saved.
Thank the fire department for what they have done.
I do not know.
You got the camera.
I see two people in the rapids in the water trying to save their lives or so.
The man over there he has the a limb over there of a tree.
But the girl i do not know if he is going to save her or not.
She is looking surprised because if it was me i would be holding with one hand and the other hand trying to save the girl.
I really do not know.
I am looking at their faces to see.
He is just looking.
I would just tell him to take one hand down and rescue the girl.
I do not know.
That is all i could see.
He kicks the ball into the neighbor's window.
Oh and and then he the neighbor is setting at this chair.
All of a sudden the ball lands in his lap.
He is cursing and cursing at the kid.
I tell him a million times not to play ball in near my yard.
He picks up the ball.
He is looking at the kid.
Now what do i do?
Do i send the ball back in a package go to his parents and complain and ask for the money for the window?
Or forgive the kid for doing what he did?
I will leave it up to you to make his mind.
He is wearing the vest so he must be uptight.
I could see my son out there going to school.
Mother is saying goodbye to him and saying.
It will i think it is going to rain.
That is what the weather man said on the channel the night before.
But no five year olds kid is going to take an umbrella.
They say.
I do not need the umbrella.
I would be an idiot to walk to school with an umbrella.
He says.
I am going out.
He walks twenty steps.
All of a sudden it starts to rain.
I am getting soaking wet.
Why don i listen to my mother?
Then he walks back over there to the house.
Momma gives him a good lecture.
She says.
Now will you take the umbrella?
I took the umbreller.
I am smiling going to school.
At least i can get to get to school dry.
Well the motto is always listen your parents even though they give us bad advice.
How do i start it over there?
There once was a a mean woman who had two daughters.
Then there was cinderella whose mother passed away.
The father remarried the women with the two daughters.
She enjoyed her life until the father remarried.
She became more or less the scullery maid for the new family.
She hadta do the dishes and clean the house and never had any new clothes.
The other daughters used to make fun of her.
She was like that until for ten years until she grew up.
But one day the mother receives an invitation to go to the king's ball.
Because the king and queen was getting angry with their son the crown prince and wanted to meet the people in the area.
Bebecause they wanted him to get married.
They were going to have a great big ball and invited the whole town.
Everyone was invited except poor cinderella.
She would stay home and play with her animal friends and all of her imaginary friends.
One day came to her a a fairy godmother.
She cried to her fairy godmother.
Everybody in the hamlet were going to the ball except her.
She would love to go to the ball.
The fairy godmother said to her.
I would dress you and make you over.
You will go to the ball.
But you would hafta go to the ball but make sure you are home by twelve of the clock midnight.
Or else everything that i have done to you will turn you back to the original state.
So they her sisters and her mother went to the ball.
They were all dressed up.
The mother was haping one of the two daughters was going to marry the princess.
Cinderella stayed home.
The grandmother turned the animals into horses and everything else and made her real beautiful.
She went to the ball by herself in a nice big chariot.
At the ball she had such a great time.
Everybody was looking at her.
He was fell madly in love with her.
They didn know who she was.
They were just looking and mad.
At the near twelve of the clock over there she looked.
She said.
Oh i hafta get home.
She left the ball.
She dropped one of her glass slippers.
And she ran back home.
She got there.
She turned back into to be a scullery maid and everything.
The prince picked up this glass slipper.
He is he is complaining to his parents.
I hafta find her.
I cannot live without her.
So he said he is going to go and visit every house in the area.
Then over there and he he going around the hamlet.
He gets to the house of cinderella.
His the stepdaughters over there would try on the slipper.
It didn fit her.
Then they said.
Then her mother said.
But he says.
I hafta have her try it on.
There she tried on the slipper.
It fit her just fine.
Then the prince went over and said to her.
She said.
They kissed.
They lived happily ever after after they got married.
Where it could not get down.
Apparently it is a father went up to save the cat.
He got stuck on a limb.
They hadta call the fire department.
To come and rescue him while the dog's barking up the tree at the father.
Then his the father's ladder is laying on the ground.
Well it looks like the girl is stranded on a a bush in the water.
The guy is trying to rescue her.
He is trying to put a lifebelt on her.
So they can pull her out.
He is got one on.
And that looks as though we are they are pretty well getting her rescued.
It is a boy playing soccer.
He kicks the soccer ball.
It goes through the window.
Then he takes the ball.
He is standing there.
Looking out to see if he is going to come and get the ball.
So it looks like somebody is in trouble.
The little boy's going to school.
Mother says.
You gonna take your umbrella with you.
He said he is going to take it.
But he gets to school.
He starts home.
He forgot his umbrella.
It is pouring down rain.
So he decides he is going to go back and get it.
He forgot his before.
He went on home without it.
So then he went back and got it.
Used his umbrella as as he come home with the umbrella.
Well it started out as a wicked witch and her two daughters.
She was taken to live with ththem.
They made a slave out of her.
They put her in every kind of a bad circumstance that they could.
She went ahead and did the work very jolly.
Then she got to wanting to do something.
So she wanted to go to this dance.
She was wishing for a prince to come and get her.
The fairy godmother waved a wand.
So he had a pair of glass slippers for her to wear.
If she was not back home by midnight well the coach would turn back to a pumpkin.
The prince would leave too.
So when she was going late getting home.
She ran off and lost one of the slippers.
So the old man he found it.
He went around trying to find who it was that who had the slippers on.
So he finally tried the wicked witch.
They could not fit into it.
They had her locked in the basement.
The two mice got the key to the locked door.
He tried it on.
It fit her.
So she become a princess after that.
She got the good handsome prince.
The little girl's reaching for it.
But she cannot reach it.
It and she had her little tricycle.
She reaching for the cat up in the tree.
But but the father tried to catch get the little cat.
He had a a ladder.
But i guess it fell with hi am or something.
Here is the dog barking.
Then here are the firemen trying to get the the both of ththem out of the tree.
They have the firetruck.
They are running ladder to get to the the man and his cat.
You take your bread.
You spread your peanut butter on it.
You slice the bananas.
Well it looks.
Looks like a little girl fell in the river river where there was branches from trees there and twigs.
She fell in there.
I guess she was hollering and scared hollering.
Wait i cannot see that.
They jumped into the water.
I do not know what that is there.
She hadta hold onto the branch to save the little girl.
But there is really dangerous.
But evidently she was saved.
He kicked it right through a window and broke the window.
Inside of the house was probably his father sitting there.
It broke the window.
It knocked over a lamp.
His dad looked very surprised.
The last picture he looked at the window.
He has the ball.
That is what i can see.
The little boy was going to school i guess.
He was going to school.
His mother wanted to give hi am the umbrella.
He would not take it.
So she was giving the umbrella.
He would not take it.
He said.
He is going on to school.
So when he got out there it started raining real hard.
He ran back to the house in the rain.
She gave him an umbrella.
He went on to school.
There was once upon a time a a ugly mother girls daughters.
I do not know who it was.
But cinderella to her home to take care of.
She hadta take care of the the cinderella.
The stepmother and daughters treated her terribly.
So she just went try to do the best she could.
She hadta do all the work for them.
One day she looked in a trunk.
There was a beautiful dress in there.
So she hung this dress up.
Then the fairy godmother came and to her and was talking to her.
So then the evidently the fairy godmother must have talked to her.
Then the the the ugly mother received a invitation to the a ball for them all.
Cinderella wanted to go.
I think she put on this pretty pink dress.
Then the fairy godmother evidently ordered a pumpkin with four horses and a fellow to to take her in there.
She was dressed up.
Then they had put beautiful clothes on her.
She danced all evening.
Then when the clock struck twelve she hadta leave.
She had this glass slipper on.
She had this glass slipper on.
She was leaving she dropped it.
They looked all over for the slipper and where the little girl was.
Well i guess the jester or the footman or somebody had tried the the slippers on all the other daughters and the mother.
But it fit the little girl cinderella.
Then then i guess the footman went back to the prince and told him.
The prince went to her and fitted her foot with the shoe.
They lived happily ever after.
First i get the bread peanut butter butter jelly out on the counter.
And i open the package.
Slice the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in half.
All of a sudden a cat crawls up in the tree.
So daddy crawls up on a branch to try to get the cat.
He is stuck.
The dog's at the bottom of the tree barking.
The little girl's still screaming.
Here comes the firemen running to save save them all.
They it is all done.
There is a young lady she is out on a nice afternoon walk.
But she is having a nice time.
She sees something.
She goes down by the river and accidentally falls in.
She is going down the river.
She gets ahold of a branch.
The aid people are called out.
A fireman rescuer goes out on a harness and gets her.
They pull her in.
Everything's fine after they check her out.
Little johnny looks like he is getting ready to go to school.
Mom's telling him here is the umbrella.
He says no no i do not need an umbrella.
So he johnny heads for school.
He gets partway.
It starts raining.
Pretty soon it is pouring.
He goes in the house.
He is all soaked.
Mom's sitting there giving him a stare.
He gets changed and dried up.
He takes his umbrella and heads for school just happy as can be.
All of a sudden he really gets his foot into it.
It goes through their picture window and falls on the floor knocks over a lamp on its way and scares dad.
Dad picks the ball up looks out the window and just staring out there through a broken pane.
All ends well.
They get the picture window fixed.
Her father gets married and shows her stepmother and stepsisters.
She stands in the her room looking out the window at the castle and dreaming.
The king in the castle he wants the prince to find a wife.
So they send out an announcement of a upcoming ball that they might introduce all the young ladies to the prince.
He might pick out a wife.
Well the stepsisters are preparing for the dance.
Their mother's helping ththem.
But they say cinderella she just is nothing.
She cannot go.
Well the little birds and all of her friends they get all the things for cinderella.
She dresses up real nice.
She is going to show ththem.
She is going to go.
They scoff at her and make fun of her and tear her her necklace off.
They leave for the party.
Well fairy godmother comes.
She waves her wand.
A pumpkin in the garden turns into a pumpkin carriage.
The mice become foot men for the carriage.
Cinderella is in a beautiful white flowing gown when she goes to the party.
Everybody notices her.
She is having a good time.
The prince is dancing with her.
She noticed the time.
She had been told that this spell goes away at midnight.
So she runs off out of the dance.
While running she drops one of the glass slippers.
The next thing she is sitting on the pumpkin.
The four mice they are just sitting.
Well the king wants to know who this girl was.
Nobody comes forward nobody.
So he is going to go through the countryside with the slipper and see who it fits.
They lock cinderella in her room so she cannot try the slipper on.
The mice they get the key to the door.
They slide it under under the door bring it to her.
She gets out.
She goes to try on the slipper.
The stepmother tries everything to keep her from it.
But finally she tries the slipper on.
Depending on the requirements of the eater you may cut off the crusts or not.
You butter the bread in my opinion.
Then you put on peanut butter.
Then you put on the jam.
Then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top.
Cut it in any way you so desire.
We have a man stranded in a tree.
Because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat.
Because a little girl was crying because a cat was up in the tree.
After the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down.
A dog came along and is barking up the tree.
The firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man.
I am assuming everything ends up okay.
This this looks like a a a picture of a flood.
Of a girl i would say rather than a young woman kind of trapped flood.
A fireman or some kind other kind of rescue personnel is going to try to rescue her.
He is hanging on for dear life to a limb.
He is got what looks like a belt over an arm.
This looks like it could be an actual picture of a real happening.
We have a boy playing outside with what looks like a soccer ball.
He kicks the soccer ball.
Which goes through a window of course breaking the window.
Which startles a man who is sitting in a chair.
The man gets youp.
An he gets the ball.
He's looking out through the broken window.
We have a mother holding an umbrella and who i would guess is going to school.
Bebecause it looks like he is got a backpack on.
He is telling her.
I do not need an umbrella.
I do not want an umbrella.
But she let us him go.
He waves goodbye.
He goes outside.
Of course it starts raining.
He is running back home through the puddles.
He is holding his head.
He goes in the house.
Because he is standing there dripping.
Then the next picture shows him back outside with an umbrella.
He has miracasly miraculously dried out.
We start out with cinderella's father remarrying to a woman who turns out to be oh a mean stepmother.
She has two daughters who she dotes on.
A father goes off on a business trip or something or other.
He dies.
He does not return.
She waits on the stepsisters.
Cinderella can look out her window and see the castle where the prince and i assume the king and queen live.
The prince is distressing his parents.
Because he is getting up in age.
He has not married.
They are telling him he has got to marry.
So they throw a big ball.
Invitations are sent to every every house.
Stepmother and stepsisters and cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that they are going to go to.
Cinderella gets a a lovely dress out of a trunk.
The stepsisters get all dressed.
Cinderella's helping them with everything.
At least in this book she gets a dress out of the trunk.
But i have never seen that before.
But anyway she helps the ladies get dressed.
She of course is planning on going.
But stepmother and stepsister say.
You cannot go.
An so they leave.
She is sitting by the fireplace and the cinders and so forth.
Fairy godmother comes along and asks cinderella if she would like to go to the ball.
Of course cinderella says.
But she has not got any way to go.
And she was told to stay home.
But fairy godmother does her magic.
Cinderella has another lovely gown.
The fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach.
I think it is mice into horses.
Somebody turns into a coachman.
They take cinderella to the ball.
The prince is taken with her.
They are dancing and so forth.
Which is when the fairy godmother told cinderella she hadta be back home.
Because she would change back into old clothes.
The coach would disappear.
So she goes running away.
As she is running away she drops a glass slipper.
She gets home.
Then the prince and his footmen are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits.
Stepsisters tried to jam their foot in the glass slipper.
Of course it did not fit.
Somehow he finds that cinderella is there.
He tries the slipper on her.
It fits.
They get married.
They live happily ever after.
Okay well a guy climbed up a tree to get a cat.
Apparently he got himself stuck there too.
So the fire department comes to get him down.
Okay so a girl got caught in a flood.
A guy came to rescue her.
He is got rescue harness kind of stuff and is having some trouble getting her out of the water into the harness because of a tree in the way.
He accidentally kicks it through a window.
So it knocks goes through a window and knocks over a lamp where this guy's sitting.
So he picks it up and he is looking out the window for you know what happened.
Okay a mom's sending her kid off to school.
She tries to give him an umbrella.
He does not want the umbrella.
Then it starts raining on him.
It is raining really hard.
So he turns around and goes back home.
She makes friends with a bunch of little animals.
There is a ball that is happening.
The little animals get a dress for her and stuff.
But her stepsisters ruin it.
But then her fairy godmother comes in and uhuh gets her a dress carriage and and glass slippers.
So she goes off to the ball.
But then she hasta run off.
The carriage turns into a pumpkin.
And so she winds up back home.
But the prince at the ball liked her and has one slipper from when she ran off.
So he finds her and sees that she fits the slipper.
So then they run off together.
You would start with two pieces of bread.
You would get out your peanut butter and jelly and a butter knife.
You put peanut butter on one piece of bread.
Then you put jelly.
You would spread it on the other piece of bread both times using the knife.
Then you put the pieces together and cut it in half.
On a very sunny summer afternoon three girls went out into the desert.
They were playing in a wash.
Even though there were no storm clouds there a storm came up in the mountains and flooded the wash.
The three little girls were swept away in the water.
One of the girls ended up finding a tree branch and held onto it for dear life.
Finally a rescue helicopter came along because some other people had seen the girls in the wash.
One of the rescue workers rappeled down the the line and attached himself to the tree and was able to get the girl and put the the harness on her and was able to hoist her out of the water.
He kicked it really really hard.
It went through the window of his neighbor's house.
The neighbor was just sitting there watching some television.
All of a sudden the soccer ball comes in.
So he gets up.
He goes to the window and he looks out.
But he does not see anyone because the little boy got scared and ran away.
There was a mom and a little boy.
They were always arguing about the little boy taking his umbrella.
He always said.
Mom i do not need it.
So just another typical day he leaves the house thinking that he is going to be fine.
It begins to rain.
He splashes through puddles.
He ends up soaked.
Finally he comes home.
He says.
Mom i am soaking wet.
I need the umbrella.
So he gets his umbrella and goes back out so he can go to school and stay dry.
There once was a beautiful girl named cinderella.
She lived in a house near the castle with her father.
Her father traveled quite a bit.
While he was away he fell in love with a woman who had two less than beautiful stepdaughters.
They came to live with cinderella.
Cinderella was quite excited bebecause she was going to have a mom and sisters.
But after her dad left things did not go so well.
They made cinderella cook.
They made cinderella clean and do their laundry and and just do everything for them.
She had a good relationship with her pets.
And so she remained happy and was was always cheery.
Meanwhile at the castle the prince is in trouble with his dad because he has not found a wife.
So they decide to hold a big ball and have all the women kingdom come so that he can find a wife.
She sets off to fix up one of her dresses.
She sews and sews and sews all night on top of having to cook and clean and do all these other things.
When the not so pretty stepsisters see her they get really mad.
They rip up her dress.
They tear off her jewelry.
Cinderella's crying until her fairy godmother comes.
Off they go to the ball.
Of course the prince falls in love with her because she is so beautiful.
But the fairy godmother told her at the stroke of midnight it all goes away.
So just as it it starts chiming midnight she runs out the door.
One of her her glass slippers falls off.
She runs off into the night.
All he has is this little glass slipper.
So the kingdom begins a search for the girl whose foot fits in the glass slipper.
So when they go to cinderella's house the stepmother tries to sabotage it so they will not find out that the slipper belongs to cinderella.
But of course they do.
Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named sally.
She had a beloved cat named fluffy.
Fluffy got chased up in the tree by a dog that lived down the street.
So her father came along and saw that she was quite upset.
He got a ladder.
He got it up and climbed up in the tree to get fluffy down for little sally.
But when he got up there the ladder fell.
Now both fluffy and dad were stuck in the tree.
So they hadta call the fire department.
The fire department rushed out and saved dad and fluffy.
Okay i think that a little dog chased a cat up a tree.
There is the little girl who is cat it was was very upset.
So she called her dad.
He climbed the tree to go retrieve the cat.
But the ladder fell off the tree that he useta climb the tree.
So the firemen came to help the man and the cat hopefully get out of the tree.
With the peanut butter on one side the jelly on the other so that they will touch.
Okay this looks like two young people that decided to go on some kind of a raft trip.
They were equipped with life preservers.
Although i do not see one on the girl.
It has overturned in rapids.
But it looks like the young woman has not been able to grab on to anything.
She held on to him while he held on to the tree.
Help was called.
They were saved.
Unfortunately the ball gets kicked through a window.
Where a man is sitting.
It knocks over a lamp.
He jumps up with the ball.
His first instinct is to look out the window to see who kicked the ball.
He does go outside.
The young boy apologizes.
The man takes him back to his home.
They make a resolution for the young boy to pay for the window that needs to be fixed.
Well little danny is going off to school.
An mom says.
I think you are going to need your umbrella.
So she offers him the umbrella.
Danny says.
Mom i do not need this umbrella.
So he starts out on his way to school with his backpack on.
It starts to drip drop.
The sky opens up.
It is pouring.
At which point little danny turns around.
He walks back in the door totally dripping wet.
Mom is looking at him saying.
See i told you so.
Danny picks up the umbrella.
There was a nice young man who lost his wife.
He knew that she needed a mom.
So he found a woman.
They decided to marry.
So now little cinderella his daughter has two stepsisters.
They grow up in the house together.
Force cinderella to do all the work in the house.
Instead of them helping out.
The stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen.
So cinderella because she works so hard has no friends.
Except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house.
They befriend her.
She sees the prince's castle from afar.
Meanwhile in that castle there is a prince.
The king is definitely ready for his son to get married.
So he decides to host a ball.
So he sends out invitations.
When cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations.
Because now they can see themselves married to the prince.
Cinderella also shares in this dream.
However cinderella's stepmother says.
Oh no you cannot go to the ball.
Because you have too many chores to do.
Forces cinderella to do even more chores.
Because she knows in her heart that cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters.
So they get all ready to go to the ball.
Cinderella goes through all her chores.
But all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also.
So they help her with the chores.
But then she realizes that she cannot go to the ball bebecause she does not have a dress.
Her fairy godmother comes to her and says.
I will help you cinderella.
So she makes a beautiful dress appear.
With a beautiful coach to take her to the ball.
That is made out of a pumpkin.
The mice she maves waves her magic wand.
That will take the carriage to the castle for the ball.
Just before cinderella takes off for the ball though she says.
After midnight the coach will turn back into a pumpkin.
The horses will turn back into friends again.
So cinderella goes to the ball.
Nobody recognizes her.
Because she is dressed beautifully.
She smells good.
The prince is so taken with her.
He cannot believe his luck.
That he has found this beautiful young woman.
But as they are taking one of their last dances.
She hears the gong from the clock tower.
She knows she hasta leave quickly.
But he does not want her to leave.
He holds her back.
She says.
No i must go.
She runs out of his arms.
Trips just a little bit before she gets into her coach.
As she trips she leaves behind one of the glass slippers.
That the fairy godmother had put on her feet.
But she has no time to go back and pick up the slipper.
So she continues.
Just as the fairy godmother promised.
At midnight the coach turned back into a pumpkin.
Well the prince is heartbroken.
He cannot believe that this woman comes into his life.
He is lost her.
He does not even really know her name.
So he decides that he is got to find her.
He runs after her.
Lo and behold he finds the glass slipper.
So he decides to go door to door to find out who is foot will fit into the glass slipper.
When he finds her he will know that that is the woman that he was dancing with.
So they go from place to place place to place.
He knocks on the stepmother's door.
She pushes her daughters into the forefront.
Both of these girls try to cram their huge gigantic feet into this tiny delicate slipper.
They will not fit at all.
He says to her.
Do you have any other daughters?
Is there anyone else that this might fit?
Of course she says.
But cinderella comes from somewhere appears and says.
Could i try on the slipper?
Her foot slides very easily into the slipper.
The prince has found his princess.
They marry.
So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you would get the loaf of bread out a peanut butter jar and your choice of jam or jelly and a knife.
Then you would get two pieces of bread.
Then you would spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and peanut butter on the other side of the bread.
Then you can put the jam on either piece of the bread that has the peanut butter on it.
Then you put the two slices together.
The reason why you put peanut butter on both sides of the bread is that then the jelly will not get soggy.
It will stay nice and firm.
Well this a story of a cat that climbed the tree.
So the little girl asked the dad to climb up the tree to get the cat.
And i when he got up the tree either the ladder fell down or the dog knocked it over.
Because the dog is is barking.
So they are stuck.
You have got the father in the tree.
He is stuck in the tree now because there is no ladder for him to get down.
The cat seems to be content up in the tree.
So somehow i do not know who called but the fire department is here.
The beginning of the story it looks like there is probably between an eight and ten year old little girl.
Somehow i do not know how she got into a raging river.
But it looks really cold.
The fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her.
He has all his equipment on.
Basically he hasta go out into this raging river.
He is grabbing on to some kind of tree limb a branch or something for his support.
Then he is got some kind of a belt or something to to pull her in or in.
There is this little boy probably ten twelve years oldd.
The ball goes through possibly maybe the neighbor's window.
The ball knocks over a lamp.
So actually it breaks the window glass and also a lamp.
The man was sitting in a chair.
Then he picks up the ball.
He looks out the window.
So i do not know what the end of the story is.
I do not know what the little boy does.
"I love this one because this is typical, typical of kids and mothers okay?"
So the little boy is getting ready to go to school.
He has a backpack on.
His mom says.
I think it is going to rain today.
Will you take the umbrethar umbrella?
The little boy goes.
I am not going to take it.
It is not going to rain.
Kids think they are smarter than the parents.
The mom says.
You need the umbrella.
But he does not take it.
So what happens?
He goes outside.
It starts to rain.
So the little boy comes back home.
He is he is soaking wet.
He comes back in.
Because in her mind she says.
I told you so.
Why do not you listen to me?
He is sopping wet.
So he takes the umbrella.
He goes to school.
I hope he learned a lesson to always listen to your mom.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella.
She lived with her dad.
Her mom had died years ago.
Then one day her dad remarried.
Cinderella was so happy to get a new mom because she missed her mom.
Well cinderella and her dad really loved each other.
But then cinderella's dad died.
So they made cinderella do all the chores.
They made her do the dishes.
They would not let cinderella be part of the family.
They made cinderella sleep upstairs in the addict.
So all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there.
She would look out her window.
She could see far beyond the city the castle.
She would sit and watch and wonder.
Oh what a beautiful place that she maybe some day would want to go and see.
Well meanwhile there was the prince.
The prince's father wanted him to get married.
Because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom.
So they decided to do a ball.
They were going to make this beautiful dance.
So the prince could pick one of the single girls to be his wife.
So they sent out invitations.
Every home got an invitation for this big dance.
Everybody was invited.
So the stepmother and the two stepsisters they were so excited to go to this dance.
They were going to dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go.
So cinderella said.
Well can i go?
The stepmother said.
Cinderella nobody wants you.
You do not have any clothes to wear.
The stepmother said.
If you do all your chores you can go.
So she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball.
So they made her a dress.
It oh it looked so pretty.
So the night of the ball cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball.
They were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done.
She comes down the stairs.
She goes.
I can go too.
The stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her.
They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear.
So they ripped the clothes off of her.
They go.
Cinderella you cannot go.
No prince would ever want to look at you.
So they said you they were off to the ball.
Poor cinderella with her torn dress stayed home.
She began to cry.
Then her fairy godmother appeared to her and said.
Cinderella you can go to the dance.
I am going to grant you this wish.
So she wished her wand.
Cinderella had the most beautiful dress on.
Her hair was made just like a beautiful princess.
She goes.
Oh this looks so beautiful.
But how am i going to get to the ball?
So the fairy godmother wished her wand.
Then she made some horses appear.
Then she gave cinderella some beautiful glass slippers.
She goes.
Cinderella i wanchu to the ball.
I want you to have the most beautiful time.
Because at midnight everything turns back.
You will have your oldd work dress on again.
So at the stroke of midnight you hafta leave.
Cinderella thanked her gramother and said.
I will have the best time.
Off to the ball she went.
When she went to the castle and she came down the stairs ev looked at her.
Everybody there whispered and said.
I do not know her.
Nobody knew her.
The prince caught eye on her.
That is the only girl that he danced with with for the rest of the night.
She had the most beautiful time dancing.
Everybody there was kind of jealous.
Because the prince would not pay any attention to them only to cinderella.
Then all of a sudden the clock was striking twelve.
Cinderella said.
I must go.
I must go.
But the prince said.
I do not even have your name.
She goes.
I needta go.
I needta go.
So she ran down the stairs.
One of her slippers fell off.
She ran back to get it.
But it struck midnight.
She goes.
I am going to turn back to my old self in my old torn dress.
So she ran off without it.
At the stroke of midnight she turned back to her oldd self with her ragged dress on.
Her pumpkin coach turned back to just a pumpkin.
All of the coachmen and the horses turned back to little mice.
But she kept one thing from the dance.
Well the next day the prince said.
I have got to find this beautiful girl.
I do not know who it is.
I am going to go through the whole countryside.
I am going to find out which girl that shoe fits.
Shoe fits on that foot dream princess.
I will marry her.
So he went all through the countryside and could not find a girl that would fit.
It did not fit.
So he came to the last house.
Her mom had had locked her in.
They tried the slipper on the two stepsisters.
It did not fit.
She knew that that the prince was there looking for her.
So she ran downstairs.
She goes.
Let me try it.
Let me try it.
Well the the evil stepmother knew that she did not want cinderella to try it on.
So she stuck her foot out.
The man holding the shoe walked and tripped and fell and broke the glass slipper.
So now the glass slipper was broken.
The prince would never never find his true love.
But cinderella had the other shoe in her pocket.
So she pulled the shoe out.
She said.
I have the other one.
Prince charming was so happy he found his true love.
They were so mad that they were not going to be part of the prince's family.
So cinderella went with the prince.
They went to the castle.
They got married.
They lived happily ever after.
Well if it is summer we take the bread out of the fridge so it does not mold overnight.
We keep our peanut butter and jam in the fridge too.
I hafta add a little extra butter though bebecause i like how that tastes.
Little girl had been riding her tricycle when she heard a dog barking.
She looked.
So she got her dad to climb the tree and get the kitty who was way out out on the end of a branch.
The ladder had been knocked over.
A little bird is chirping away like nothing at all happened.
This is rushing.
It it is got to be a flash flood because the water is so muddy.
The young man looks quite strong.
He is got muscles.
He is got a lifejacket and some other belts.
I cannot quite figure out what he is doing.
But he is trying to i would say rescue the little girl who does not have on a lifejacket.
He is hanging on to branches.
I mean in the picture it almost looks like she is trying to rescue him.
But i mean he looks tangled in the branches.
But yeah i know i would like to hear how this story ends.
Well i am going to say somehow he grabs onto her.
She must have the branch down at the bottom.
But you know hopefully get safe and get out of there.
Ball goes crashing through a living room window.
The gentleman in there jumps.
So he is not going to be too hard on him.
Has him mow the grass to work off the price of the window.
Looks like mom and her son are having an argument about who gets to take the umbrella.
Mom mom keeps it.
Little boy is smiling though says “goodbye”.
He is walking to school.
It starts to sprinkle.
Then it starts raining harder.
So he turns around.
Can i back up?
Little boy says.
No mom i do not want to take the umbrella.
Mom's angry because she really wants him to bebecause she can see that it is going to rain no matter what.
So he runs back home.
I guess i will take that umbrella after all.
Then he heads back to school in the rain.
Happy that he is got the umbrella.
There once was a beautiful little girl whose mother had died.
Her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her.
Unfortunately he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom.
She had two spoiled rotten little girls.
Then unfortunately he also passed away.
So the the mom and the stepsisters made little cinderella do all the work.
She did not have anyone to talk to.
So she made friends with the animals.
She would go out and feed them.
They would talk together.
One day the the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife.
So he sent out an invitation to all the eligible young women in the land.
The evil stepmother got the invitation and read it.
They said.
You know okay sure cinderella you can go.
But you do not have anything to wear.
So the little animals made her a dress.
They made it look beautiful.
They sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she would be able to get it done and go to the ball.
So when it was time to leave she came down.
The sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be.
They said.
They ripped the things off bebecause they said she stole it from them even though they had thrown the the stuff away earlier.
So now she really does have nothing to wear.
They take off.
Her teardrops bring her fairy godmother.
A i do not know the guy that drives it.
The guy that opens the door.
Makes her a beautiful gown prettier than what the animals made.
She goes off to the palace.
The prince sees her when she comes in.
He stops dancing with all the other fair maidens in the land.
The stepmother and the stepsisters think they have seen this beautiful girl before.
But he dances with her the rest of the night.
He falls in love with her.
Starts running down the steps.
She loses one of her shoes but cannot go back bebecause she does not want the prince to know that she is just girl.
She does not want him to see her in rags.
She gets home.
But she does get to keep the shoe.
Well the prince is devastated.
He is got to find her.
So he gives his i do not know what you call ththem right hand man the shoe.
Has him try it on every fair maiden in the land.
But he they see cinderella.
They have her try it on.
She magically transforms back into her beautiful self.
They get married.
First of all i pull out the bread.
Then i hafta go in the cupboard and get the peanut butter.
We keep our jelly in the refrigerator.
So i hafta open up the refrigerator pull out the jelly.
Actually i like a lot of peanut butter.
So i usually would put it on both slices of the bread.
The girl's pet which is a cat got stuck up in a tree.
The father tells his daughter that he will get the cat down out of the tree.
The loses the ladder that he got up into the tree.
So now the cat and the father are both stuck up in the tree.
But that is just to see what is going on.
Bebecause the dog probably is the one that chased the cat up in the tree to begin with.
Then somebody called the fire department of course to get everybody out of the tree.
They are washing ththem down stream probably.
He they finally hung up on a tree.
Anyways it looks like they they got a belt tied around something.
Looks like hopefully they are looking up.
Rescue these two people who are tied up in this situation.
He kicks it up in the air.
Lord behold it goes through the window.
Which would be a lot better even though it went through a window.
But anyways it goes through the window.
And lands in the living room where this man is sitting.
The man gets up.
Looks out the window to see who threw the ball of course.
Hopefully he does not get too mad at the little boy that kicked the ball through the window.
The little boy is going to go be going to school.
The mother wants the boy to take an umbrella along.
But of course most of the time the kids think they know it all.
He says.
I do not want to take the umbrella.
Sure enough on the way to school it starts raining.
He hasta run back home.
Of course by the time he gets home he dripping wet.
Because he did not take the umbrella.
Because he has the umbrella.
It looks like with a clean change of clothes and probably everything else that goes along with it.
Cinderella was brought into the family as a stepchild.
There were two other sisters family.
They used her as basically a maid to do all the chores and and all the cleaning and everything else around the house.
Because they wanted to make her happy.
An invitation came to the family for the the sisters to go to a ball with the prince was giving.

In the meantime cinderella also wanted to go to the ball.
Her dress was made by mice.
And the animals basically made her dress.
She met a.
No no no no no no she had her dress made.
When their mother saw her dress it was more beautiful than her sisters' was.
So consequently they ripped it apart and and did not want her to go of course to the ball at all.
She then of course got very sad.
The fairy godmother appeared to cinderella and told her that she would be able to go to the ball.
She would have her dress for her.
They had a carriage which was of course a pumpkin.
But the only thing was that cinderella would hafta leave by twelve of the clock be from the ball.
Because if she did not she would turn back into her normal or her regular self again.
So she went to the ball.
The prince noticed her and really liked her.
It got to be twelve of the clock.
She finally figured out that she hadta leave.
So running out of the castle the clock struck twelve.
In the meantime while running out of the castle she lost her shoe.
After she got back home the prince found the shoe.
Wanted to know who that beautiful woman was that belonged to the shoe.
Went around to the whole valley or whatever it was trying on the shoe with all the women to see which foot it would fit.
Because he really was in love with that the person who fitted the shoe.
He got came across the house that cinderella lived in.
The mother had her locked in a room.
Because she did not want her to be let out for the prince to even try on the shoe.
Anyways the mice found the key.
The butler tried on the shoe.
It fit cinderella.
Basically she got married to the prince.
They lived happily ever after.
You first of all you put peanut butter on both sides.
I would get rye bread.
I would put on the counter.
I would get the peanut butter.
I would spread the peanut butter on.
I put it on thick for myself.
Then i put the jelly on.
The girl is playing outside riding her bike.

There is a flash flood that has occurred.
She wants to get home very quickly because she has a family waiting for her.

He kicks the ball into the window.
He kicks the ball at the window.
The ball goes into a person's house.

It looks like the lamp is broken bebecause there is little pieces on the floor.
The person that is sitting in his chair next to the lamp is very surprised.

The man gives the ball ball back.
Everyone is happy because the boy got the ball back.

She has a nice life because of the animals because she can talk to the animals.
She knows that the animals love her.
She loves them.

He is gets a letter written.
The mother stepmother reads the letter and tells the daughters only two of ththem that they are going to be going to the the ball.

He is kicking it up practicing.
Then accidentally one of the times he kicked the ball he hit the window.
It broke through the window.
What is going on here?
He sees the ball come into the house.
So his father gets up and grabs the ball.
He figures that his son must have been playing soccer ball.
His mother was telling him to take the umbrella bebecause it might rain.
So the little boy waves to her and says no he does not need it.
So he proceeds going to school when all of a sudden it starts to rain.
He is going to get all wet.
So he turns around and goes back home to his mother.
So then his mother gives him the umbrella and goes back to school.
She goes over to this big house where she this lady has a couple of daughters that are very wealthy.
So they have this young girl that is about their age.
So one day they received a letter.
It was an invitation to a big celebration where they were going to have dancing and at i guess at a prince house.
So she was reading it out loud when cinderella was in the room and was excited for them because they were going to this big ball.
Her being young she wished that she could go to something like that.
But she knew that she could never attend just anything like that.
They were getting ready.
They were preparing for the big day.
So they ended up having their dresses made.
The day it was getting closer and closer.
So cinderella was upset because it was getting closer for that time.
She knew that she was not going to be able to go.
So all of a sudden she just wished that she could just go.
The fairy popped out of nowhere and told her that she could go.
That she could make it possible for her.
She just could not believe this.
She had little mice friends that were consoling her trying to calm her down bebecause she was upset.
She is got this look on her face like it is unbelievable.
So this she said that your wish will come true and that she would have a dress for her.
So she opens the closet and she finds this dress specially made for her.
So then the day comes when it is time to go.
They had her working at the house.
They were all laughing and making fun of her bebecause she hadta stay behind to clean the house.
When all of a sudden they all all left.
All of a sudden the fairy comes back and asked her.
Are not you going to go to this ball?
She says.
I have no way of going.
So then she all of a sudden gets her magic wand.
Then there is a chariot waiting for her outside.
So she gets all excited.
They help her put her dress on and and her special slippers that that that that were made for her.
So then she goes on ball.
Then she had been told fairy that she hadta be home by midnight.
So she was there having a wonderful time when she noticed that it was almost midnight.
So she hadta leave.
The gentleman that she was dancing with was falling in love with her.
She just hadta leave.
She kept looking at the clock.
She said she hadta leave.
So then they left.
She left running.
As she was running she lost one of her slippers.
So then she finally got home.
She noticed that she only had one slipper.
The all she had left was this one glass shoe.
The mice were just there listening to her story when the gentleman that was chasing after her as she was leaving he found this glass slipper and was trying to find out who was the girl that was wearing.
So he looked all over.
So finally they he came down to asking around and see where else this girl could be.
Finally he went down to their home where this cinderella was.
He spotted her.
She had small feet.
So he had asked her if he could try the shoe on.
So she tried it on.
Then that is how he found out that was her.
The little girl saw her cat on top of the tree and could not get her cat down.
So she went and got her dad to get some help to help get the cat out the tree.

Once upon a time there was a little girl named cinderella.
Unfortunately her father passed away.
She was sent to live with her stepmother and stepsisters who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful.
They made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun.
As she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm.
One day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son.
Because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that somebody was would be able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king.
So couriers went across the land and delivered the message or delivered invitations to all the eligible bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom.
Cinderella was excited too.
But then they laughed at her saying.
You cannot go to the ball.
You do not have a dress.
But her friends the animals made a dress for her so so she could go to the ball.
They thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball.
So they ripped the dress up.
Cinderella was sent down cellar.
She cried.
Then all of a sudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying.
She told her story to the fairy godmother.
The fairy godmother waved her wand.
Cinderella had a beautiful dress with with glass slippers.
Then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin.
It turned into a beautiful carriage.
She waved her wand over the mice.
The mice turned into horses.
So cinderella arrived royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress.
She met the prince.
They danced the night away.
Fairy godmother had warned cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight.
So cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away.
The prince tried to catch her because he was so enchanted with her.
But he could not catch up with her.
She cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her glass slippers on the stairs.
She made it to the carriage and got home just in time.
The carriage turned back into a pumpkin.
The horses turned back into mice.
The prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party bebecause his heart belonged to her now.
So he sent couriers across the land again with the the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper.
Then he would know who who was the beautiful woman at the ball.
So when the courier got to cinderella's house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting to try the slippers on.
But unfortunately they the slippers did not fit either one of them.
Cinderella came out of the cellar and sat down.
The courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle.
She and the prince lived happily ever after.

So the cat ran up the tree.
But it got stuck because it went further and further and further out on the limb.
Amina's father came and said.
I will go up.
I will rescue the cat.
He climbed up.
But then the ladder fell over.
He got stuck.
They noticed he was stuck in the tree.
They called the fire department which is kind of an overreaction bebecause they could have just fixed the ladder themselves.
Bird was singing very contentedly over this entire scene.
One day after school tyler was playing soccer in the front yard.
He did an amazing kick that kicked so well that the ball went all the way through the window of his house and right into his dad's lap.

One morning this little boy was going to school.
His mother was saying.

So once upon a time there was a little girl.
She loved her father very much.
But her mother died.
So her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl.
This woman came with two daughters.
We hafta be honest.
So there is a great deal of stress after cinderella's father apparently died.
She was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters.
They made her live in the attic.
They made her wear old ugly clothes.
She befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds.
When she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of fantasialand.
So she useta dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown.
But she never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she did not have any nice clothes to wear.
They always said to her.
You will never go to the ball.
You will never go the palace.
So one day the invitation came that they were going to have dance because the king was sick and tired of his son not getting married.
All the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men.
It was time for the prince to get married because one day he is going to be the king.
He needed to have children.
He needed to have a wife.
So they were going to have a big ball.
So they were having a ball.
Cinderella's ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go.
They were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes.
Cinderella really really wanted to go.
She was very sad bebecause she thought there was no way that she could ever go.
They knew how to sew.
They knew how to accessorize.
They knew how to design dresses apparently.
So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for cinderella.
At the ball she met the prince.
He loved her and she loved him.
They had a wonderful time dancing.
Then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there.
They were pulling her dress.
They were tearing her scarves.
They chased her away and made her go home.
But then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry.
So he sent out a message to all the houses in the land saying he wanted to come because he had found the glass slipper that she had left.
He was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry.
But the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and would not let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper.
So the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out.
Then the prince did find her.
Then they got married.
We do not really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters.

The fairy godmother says to her.
She kind of blesses her with her wand and turns her into a beautiful woman with a dress and everything.
So she goes to the ball.
She meets prince charming.

Hadta think about that.
She was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them.
The little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree.
So she went and found a ladder.
She was going to put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said.
I will get the cat out of the tree.
At which point the dog came back and scared the man.
He ran up into the tree.
So she hadta call the the firemen so that they could come and rescue everybody.
He had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him.
But his dad said.
I hafta watch tv.
So little billy was kicking the ball around by himself.
Then the ball went too far.
It went through the window.
It smashed into the living room where little billy's dad was watching tv.
Little billy's dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said.
Guess i should have gone out there and played with him.
Now i have dysfunctional family stories.
His mom said.
Little billy before you leave make sure you take an umbrella.
Little billy said.
Mom i live in arizona.
It never rains here.
I certainly will not need an umbrella.
Mom said.
He got about halfway to school when he started to feel raindrops on his head.
He said.
Maybe it will pass.
But the longer it went on the harder it rained.
So he ran all the way home.
He said.
You know what mom?
I should have taken an umbrella.
So she gave him the umbrella.
Little billy continued to walk to school.
He thought to himself.
So cinderella was living with her father.
Her mother had died a long time ago.
Her father had decided.
It is time that you had a mother.
You need some brothers and sisters.
So he went out into the town.
He found a woman who he thought he could like.
He married her and brought her and her two daughters into the house and told cinderella.
Here you go.
You now have a new mother.
You have new sisters to go along with it.
Well what the father did not know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet.
They treated cinderella horribly.
They made her do all the cooking.
They made her do all the cleaning while he was off sailing around the world.
That is why he did not know what was going on.
She is taking care of everything.
The evil stepsisters are just you know bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do.
She would talk to them.
They would talk to her because they had that special communication.
Then one day from where cinderella was at she when she would talking with the animals she could see the whole town that she lived in.
Off in the distance she could see the castle where the prince lived.
She always thought.
Wow it would be so neat if i could live in a castle.
But i am cinderella and that will not ever happen because i hafta make sure that i take care of my stepmother and my evil stepsisters.
Meanwhile over in the castle the advisor to the prince is starting to get worried because the prince is still single.
People in the town are starting to talk.
So he says.
Okay here is what we will do.
We will put this whole proclamation thing out.
We will get all the single ladies to come to the castle.
We will let the prince pick one.
You know with all the women there is got to be one that he is going to like.
So we will bring ththem all here.
So they send out a message to everybody in the town.
They say.
Okay we are having this big birthday party for the prince.
Because he is going to be picking a wife.
The evil stepmother gets this message.
She says.
I am going to put my daughters because then we can get out of this hovel and move back in to a big castle.
Cinderella thinks.
Maybe i could get into this because i am pretty good at you know sewing and everything.
I have actually made a dress.
So you know i should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters.
So she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room.
The stepsisters see it and decide.
Wow she looks a lot better than we do.
So we cannot let that happen.
So they rip up her dress.
Then they take her.
They shove her in a closet and lock her away.
Then they take off and go.
While she is upset she finds this book.
While flipping through the book she sees a reference to a fairy godmother.
So she reads the reference and all of a sudden poof fairy godmother shows up.
She says.
Well cinderella i am here to help you out because you have been a very hard worker and you do good things.
I am going to grant you some wishes.
We are going to get you to this ball.
So cinderella says.
Okay well how do we make this happen?
She said.
Well first we need the a way to get you there.
So she takes cinderella's little animal friends.
She turns them into all the things that she needs to get her to the ball.
She turns the mice into coachmen.
She turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into a big carriage.
So she does all of this.
Then she says.
Bing and here is a fabulous dress to go along with it.
The catch is is that you got to be back by midnight.
Cinderella says.
I can live with that.
So she goes over to the coach.
They get in there and they take her up.
She is escorted into the big ball party.
Everybody is looking going.
Wow who is that amazing looking girl over there?
We have never seen her before.
So she comes in.
The stepsisters see her.
She looks familiar but we cannot quite place her.
So the prince sees her and says.
Wow you are a pretty good looking girl.
Let us go dance.
Let us talk.
So they are dancing.
They are talking.
They are having a great time.
I think i found the woman of my dreams.
When she happens to look at the clock and says.
Oh i got to go and takes off.
While she is running off to get back into the coach she loses a shoe.
So she drops the shoe.
But she manages to make it back just in time.
Everything goes back to normal.
But she still has the other glass slipper.
So she says.
So she holds on to that.
Well i got to find this girl because this is the woman of my dreams.
So i have this shoe.
It will fit whoever was wearing it.
So i will just go around to all the women in the village.
I will try and put this shoe on them.
Whoever fits is the woman i am looking for.
So he goes from house to house to house.
Some people just they do not have feet at all so they do not even get to wear it.
He finally comes to the evil stepsisters' and the stepmother's house.
He is trying to get the shoe onto the stepsisters' feet.
So they just do not fit.
Not because she thinks it is her or anything.
She wants to keep her dnrn and and back off to the side.
So so the mice realize.
Hey we got to get cinderella out because this is her really chance to to excel and shine.
So they smuggle the key in.
She unlocks the door.
She comes out.
Hey i think you found my shoe.
He went.
Well let me see your foot.
So he puts it on.
Lo and behold the shoe fits.
You no no no you cannot do this.
I am pulling her out of this hovel.
You all stay over here.
I am taking the woman off to my dreams.
