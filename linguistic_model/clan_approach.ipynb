I\\'ve literally had my son say that to me a few times.',\n 'So, what was I to do except fulfilling his demand?',\n 'Baking (not only pies), is a cooking method where tools DO actually make the man, which means that it is very hard or nearly impossible to do it successfully without proper bakeware.',\n \"With years of experience under my belt, I've learned about and discovered what truly matters when looking for bakeware to buy, and I am going to teach you later in the article.\",\n 'Also, I have reviewed what I believe to be the best five non-stick bakeware sets out there, so make sure to check them out if you are in search of one.',\n \"The first and most obvious reason is - because food doesn't stick to it!\",\n 'I do not want to sound overly simplistic, but any chef (or mom, as a matter of fact) knows that pans that stick will absolutely mess up the outcome.',\n \"People normally solve this problem by oiling up, but I don't like it since it makes the food greasy.\",\n 'Using non-stick bakeware is a healthier, more convenient, and more practical way of baking.',\n 'The next thing that you might not have known is that non-stick bakeware is so much easier to clean than more conventional types.',\n \"It is a no-brainer really - if nothing sticks to the surface then there won't be anything to scrub, scrape or wash off.\",\n 'This trait right here will save you tons of time as well as frustration, and it might motivate you to bake more often because of the hassle-free cleaning process.',\n 'Just make sure to maintain the bakeware.',\n '\\u200bLastly, even heat distribution is another thing that you should look for, and this type of bakeware enables it.',\n \"Here's the deal: heat distribution most likely won't affect the quality of the result, but it will make the bakeware heat up more quickly which will ultimately decrease the cooking time.\",\n 'Investing a little bit of time into research can save you a lot of money and trouble in the long run, and that is why you need to read this section carefully.',\n 'Bakeware sets differ regarding materials, abilities, cost, and maintenance, so learning about some general features of these products will help you decide which type will fulfill your demands.',\n 'Bakeware can be made from different kinds of materials including iron, glass, copper, steel, etc.',\n 'Today I will mention only the types that are related to products I reviewed in this article.',\n 'It is important to know that each material yields different cooking properties so study these paragraphs to find out which one is right for you.',\n 'Carbon steel - this material is light, durable, and reacts to temperature changes very quickly, meaning that it can heat up fast.',\n \"Even though is lightweight, it is a bit heavier than copper and doesn't retain heat as well as iron.\",\n \"It's a good choice for baking meats, veggies, bread, and cakes.\",\n \"Copper - it is an excellent heat conductor and doesn't need pre-heating since it gets hot very quickly.\",\n 'Very light, but also quite expensive compared to other bakeware materials.',\n \"Also, it isn't the best choice for recipes that require baking under very high heat.\",\n 'Silicon - good for foods where sticking is an issue, such as breads, cookies, and cakes.',\n 'It is light, affordable and dishes will slide out of it easily.',\n 'The one downside is that it can be frustrating to wash because it is so elastic, but luckily, most of the silicon bakeware is dishwasher safe.',\n \"Since you'll be buying an entire set of products, it would be a good idea to find one that is suitable for all kinds of baking jobs.\",\n 'Make sure that all the basic items such as pie pan, muffin pan, loaf pan, cookie sheet, cake pan, or whatever you need, is included in the package.',\n 'This is a feature that most folks overlook, and it makes a world of difference when it comes to handling the pan.',\n \"It's easy to move the dish around when it's cold but taking it out of a scorching hot oven is a different story (trust me, I know).\",\n \"You'll try to be cautious not to burn your fingers so it is easy not to pay attention to the contents of the pan which can lead to spillage and a messy kitchen.\",\n 'Look for bakeware that has nice, ergonomic handles or handling areas.',\n 'Some models have silicon added to these parts for extra protection and ease of use.',\n 'Not all types of bakeware can withstand the same temperatures; as a matter of fact, this trait greatly differs from product to product.',\n 'Certain pans are oven safe to up to 000 degrees Fahrenheit, while others cannot take more than 000.',\n 'This is a significant difference so pay close attention to this detail when buying a set.',\n \"Now, let's get into the meaty part of this article - the reviews.\",\n \"After trying out many sets, I've reached some conclusions and decided to put together a list of my favorite ones.\",\n 'Keep in mind that these are my personal choices, but they are also top rated products.',\n 'Rachel Ray is a world-renowned chef and TV personality, and her famous Cucina line of products never fails to deliver.',\n 'Here, we are dealing with an excellent, 00-piece set that I personally think very highly of.',\n 'The material that this bakeware is made of is carbon steel, and the non-stick, latte-colored coating looks very pretty and does the job well.',\n \"A thing that I didn't like about the construction of this set is that everything is so bulky.\",\n 'It is not a huge issue, but folks who lack storage space will not be thrilled with these products.',\n 'As far as items are concerned, the set includes two loaf pans, two cake pans, two cookie sheets, two pie plates, a muffin tin, and a plastic cake pan topper.',\n \"In my opinion, this is more than enough, but I'm sure some folks are going to be disappointed because there's no pizza pan included.\",\n 'The handles have silicon grips attached to them, and this is a big bonus when it comes to practicality and handling.',\n 'Also, the rolled edges allow you to grab the pan more easily and move it around securely.',\n 'The pan can withstand heat of up to 000 F, and I think that this should be sufficient for most baking jobs.',\n 'Make sure not to go over this temperature because you could burn the pans.',\n 'Copper has gained a lot of popularity in the cooking world over the last few years, and honestly, I can only say good things about it.',\n 'Copper Chef is known for a plethora of cookware, and now we are taking a look at their baking set.',\n \"As I've mentioned before, copper is a fantastic heat conductor, and the heat distribution in this material is as even as it gets.\",\n 'Personally, I find the latter feature very important because I like to have consistency in my cooking.',\n 'This is a 00-piece set that consists of a 00-cup muffin pan, a cookie sheet, a loaf pan, a square pan, and eight pieces of silicon ramekin cups with lids.',\n 'Ok, so I think it is a bit unfair for a company to advertise a set of twelve copper products while only four of them are actually made of this material.',\n 'While the ramekin cups are lovely, they seem to be a cheap filler in this set.',\n 'As far as handling is concerned, most of the products in this pack do not have handles, so you have to rely on the rolled edges for gripping.',\n 'This is a big disadvantage in my opinion, and greatly handicaps the ease of use.',\n 'These black, sturdy-looking baking dishes remind me of old-school bakeware sets that people used to bake with a few decades ago.',\n 'However, this is a modern and versatile set that should fulfill most of your demands.',\n \"The ChefLand set is made of carbon steel; it looks pretty plain but has a non-stick coating that's quite effective.\",\n \"One thing that this material is good at is even heat distribution, so you won't need to worry about hotspots.\",\n 'The products are dishwasher safe, however, after several months of kind of cleaning, some items started to form rust on the outer edges, which is a big minus.',\n 'I would recommend washing them by hand.',\n \"When it comes to the items, ChefLand's set includes a roasting pan, a round pizza pan, a large and medium cookie sheet, two round cake pans, a square cake pan, a loaf pan, an oven crisper pan, and a 00-cup muffin pan.\",\n \"As far as I'm concerned this set has everything covered!\",\n \"Most of the dishes have handles on them, and even those which don't, have a nice grip area that allows for good handling.\",\n 'Unfortunately, there is no silicon padding or protective surface so you will need to use gloves or cloth.',\n \"This bakeware set comes to us from Sunbeam; it is a bit smaller set in terms of the number of items in it, but a worthy addition to today's list.\",\n \"Oh, I forgot to mention it's cheap as chips!\",\n 'The material these pans are made of is carbon steel, and its non-stick features are achieved with a xylan coating interior and exterior.',\n 'The black color gives it a pretty plain, non-exciting look, but I personally do not mind this.',\n 'The Sunbeam set has only 0-pieces, which is significantly less than other sets we reviewed today.',\n 'The dishes included are a loaf pan, a cookie sheet, a 0-cup muffin pan, and two round cake pans.',\n 'One disadvantage of this set is that it cannot handle temperatures higher than 000 F, which is quite limiting because some recipes require more heat.',\n 'All of the pans have handles or enough room to grab them properly and handle safely.',\n 'Now as I was reading some online commentary, many people complained that pans arrived dented or bent when they ordered them, so this might be an issue.',\n \"I haven't experienced this myself, so I just want to put it out as a warning.\",\n \"This set differs from others I reviewed today because it is the only one that's not made of metal.\",\n 'Boxiki Kitchen brings us this 0-piece silicone set that bread and cake lovers might find interesting.',\n \"As I've said, these products are made of silicone which has its pros and cons.\",\n \"The good thing is that food will just slide out of it, but it might be irritating when trying to wash it by hand because it's so bendy.\",\n \"A lot of people raise concerns about chemicals in this material, so you'll be glad to know that this set is FDA approved and non-toxic.\",\n 'The set comes with three items - a round cake pan, a square brownie pan, and a banana bread/meatloaf pan.',\n \"All of the dishes are equipped with metal handles which allows for a nice and solid grip, so you won't have to worry about the pans slipping out of your hands.\",\n \"Silicone is generally oven safe up to 000 degrees F, which is fantastic and much better than some metal products, so you won't need to worry about burning your bakeware.\",\n \"However, the metal handles don't seem to take high temperatures very well, and I've heard some reports of them flaking and bubbling at 000 F. I hope that the article was helpful and that it got you acquainted with the basics of bakeware.\",\n \"Now, the time has come for me to declare my top pick of the day, and the product that got most of my sympathies is Rachel Ray's 00-piece Cucina Set.\",\n 'Its beautiful design is what attracted me to this bakeware set, but the excellent performance made an even stronger impression.',\n 'Non-stick surface does its job flawlessly, and the carbon steel construction is sturdy and strong.',\n \"This is a very good list, i have tested myself the Rachel Ray's 00-Piece Cucina Bakeware Set and i'm satisfied with it, it fulfill most of my daily cooking.\",\n 'Are film trailers spoiling movies?',\n 'In April we asked if high ticket prices were ruining your visits to the cinema.',\n 'Yes, you said overwhelmingly.',\n \"But something else has put a strain on my relationship with the cinema - and it's not the popcorn.\",\n \"Have you ever gone to your local cinema to watch a new film only to feel you've seen it before?\",\n 'I know I have.',\n \"‘Spoilerific' film trailers are now often so detailed it seems hardly worth watching the movie itself.\",\n 'Imagine if the trailer for Casablanca

would have wanted.',\n \"In the last couple of months, I've paid £00.00 a ticket to see two films I've been anticipating for some time.\",\n \"OK £00.00 sounds steep, but that was for iMAX 0D and I'd still have paid more than £00 for a ‘normal' ticket.\",\n \"But I left the cinema unfulfilled, because I felt like I'd seen them both six months before.\",\n 'In both cases the trailer revealed the

Lost Ark, and 0000's Goldfinger to get a bigger picture.\",\n \"Both revealed some well-known scenes (including Goldfinger's iconic laser and dialogue), but the plot basics were instead explained by voiceover, rather than any especially huge visual giveaways.\",\n 'Besides, the chance of actually seeing these trailers was significantly lessened due to the technology available at the time of release.',\n 'Which got me thinking further.',\n \"‘If you don't like it, don't watch it', I hear you cry.\",\n 'I wish it were that simple.',\n 'In the age of the internet, exposure has increased

when you try to avoid spoilers, sometimes it's out of your control.\",\n 'When I went to see Mad Max, they showed the afore-mentioned trailer and before I realised, it was too late.',\n 'It cannot be unseen.',\n 'Even the director, Alan Taylor, was unhappy about the spoilers in the trailer.',\n 'Genisys was [spoiler alert] ..... indeed half of the inspiration for this convo.',\n \"I saw that

integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstraße into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the

is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you have seen your share before.',\n 'the plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound.',\n 'many of the characters are heavily stereotyped the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station

high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market.',\n 'while that was a far more drama oriented film, with the shepherd he has returned to the high kicking, no brainer

very little in the way of any exciting action.',\n 'what little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo mosped up effects added to them

the desperation.',\n 'vd gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he is never been a robert de niro sort of actor, that cannot be good.',\n 'as the villain, lord should not expect to

since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie.',\n 'most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are.',\n 'this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years.',\n 'van damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to van

all.\",\n 'a lot of the times the dialogue does not match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot.',\n 'the end fight is one of the better van damme

years, especially in the fight he has for pretty much no reason in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with scott, but look in his eyes.',\n 'jcvd seems to be dead inside.',\n 'there is nothing in his eyes at all.',\n 'it is like he just does not care about anything throughout the whole film.',\n 'and this is the leading man.',\n 'there are other dodgy aspects to the film, script wise and visually, but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film.',\n 'a genuine shame as i know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been.',\n 'there are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves.',\n 'this film had a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opponent for jcvd to face down.',\n 'this could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls out action movie stakes.',\n 'sincerely a shame that this did not happen.',\n 'it actually pains me to say it,

him?',\n 'i find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together undisputed two arguably the best western martial arts movie in years, created this.',\n 'everything from the plot, to the dialog, to the editing, to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical.',\n 'scott adkins who is fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel, was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because one he is more than capable of playing that role and two the actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying.',\n 'again, not blaming van damme.',\n 'i will always be a fan, but avoid this one.',\n \"technically i'am a van damme fan, or i was.\",\n 'this movie is so bad that i

wrong?',\n \"all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero, but i guess we will not be able to see that soon, as our hero keep coming with those going to a border far away town and kill the bad guys than comeback home movies i mean for god's sake, we are in two thousand and eight, and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level.\",\n 'why?',\n 'do your self a favor, skip it seriously.',\n 'honestly awful film, bad editing, awful lighting, dire dialog and scrappy screenplay.',\n 'the lighting at is so bad there is moments you cannot even see what is going on, i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that did not help.',\n 'they must have found the script in a bin, the character development is just as awful

terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it is just unreal.',\n \"there is not a lot else to say other than it is really bad and nothing like jean claude van damme's earlier work which you could enjoy.\",\n 'avoid like the plaque, frankly words fail me in condemning this film.',\n \"this flick is a waste of time.i expect from an action movie to have more than two explosions and some shooting.van damme's acting is awful.\",\n 'he never was much of an actor, but here it is worse.he was definitely better in his earlier movies.',\n 'his screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners.the whole dialog in the film is a disaster, same as the plot.the title the shepherd makes no sense.',\n 'why did not they just call it border patrol?',\n 'the fighting scenes could have been better, but either they were not able to afford it, or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas.this is a cheap low type of action cinema.',\n 'blind date columbia pictures, one thousand, nine hundred and thirty four, was a decent film, but i have a few issues with this film.',\n 'first of all, i do not fault the actors in this film at all, but more or less, i have a problem with the script.',\n \"also, i understand that this film was made in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's and people were looking to escape reality, but the script made ann sothern's character look weak.\",\n \"she kept going back and forth between suitors and i

first watched this movie back in the midlate eighty's, when i was a kid.\",\n 'we could not even get all the way through it.',\n 'the dialog, the acting, everything about it was just beyond lame.',\n

wish i had!',\n 'this movie was pretty poor.',\n 'though retitled do not look in the attic, the main admonition that is repeated in this is do not go to the villa.',\n 'just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea.',\n 'a character does not go into the attic until an hour into the movie, and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there.',\n 'the movie starts in

this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different.',\n 'it is true, sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie.',\n 'i also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale, in which movies with illustrations on

one is too low budget and slow paced to be scary, and does not have any real surprises in the climax.',\n 'no special effects or gore to speak of, in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the english dubbing, which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie.',\n \"three out of ten, pretty low in the pecking order of eighty's haunted house movies.\",\n 'now, i love italian horror films.',\n 'the cheesier they are, the better.',\n 'however, this is not cheesy italian.',\n 'this is week old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs.',\n 'it is amateur hour on every level.',\n 'there is no suspense, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film.',\n 'the special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost or whatever it was supposed to be is around, and a string pulling bed sheets up and down.',\n 'oooh, can you feel the chills?',\n 'the dvd quality is that of a vhs transfer which actually helps the film more than hurts it.',\n 'the dubbing is below even the lowest bad italian movie standards and i gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious!',\n 'and what do we discover when she finally does look in the attic in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the nextwell, i will not spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let us just say that it is not very novel!',\n 'this cheap, grainy filmed italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.',\n 'i was not impressed by this.',\n 'it was not really that scary, mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be.',\n \"a girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason i could not figure out why and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place.\",\n 'characters come in and out of the film, and it is quite boring at points, and the majority of deaths are quite rushed.',\n 'the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy i could not figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe i just do not remember goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off.',\n 'hate to give away the ending, but oh well.',\n 'the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later.',\n 'the end.',\n 'you really are not missing anything, and anyway, you probably will not find this anywhere, so lucky you.',\n 'i just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that i did not enjoy it a bit.',\n 'it is so slow slow and uninteresting.',\n 'this kid from harry potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother, and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy

driving car and life!',\n 'i could not get how an eighteen year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her eightys.',\n 'sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it, i could be wrong as i am not british and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life.',\n 'mostly the movie is made for the british audience.',\n 'ben,

mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness.',\n 'of course it is corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it, too and walters, who could sleep walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted, is excellent.',\n 'it is when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character, like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink, that she is at her best.',\n 'the problem is she is the only interesting character in the film and it is not because of the script which does not do anybody any favours.',\n \"grint, on the other hand, is not just unhappy he is a bit of a bore as well while linney's starched bitch is completely one dimensional.\",\n 'still, she is got the english accent off pat.',\n 'the best that can be said for it is

practically bulge out of its sockets.',\n \"julie walters's scenery chewing especially the scene when she plays god is even more shameless than her character.\",\n 'at least this harold bangs some bimbo instead of maude.',\n 'for that, i am truly grateful.',\n 'and if you are reading this mr. maltin, you owe me $three.ninety nine!',\n 'low budget horror movie.',\n 'if you do not raise your expectations too high, you will probably enjoy this little flick.',\n 'beginning and end are pretty good, middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot.',\n 'quite a bit of gore.',\n \"i enjoyed bill mcghee's performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture, he managed

obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd i wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be.',\n 'we are beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out, almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel, sentenced to redeem himself from sins, both venial and mortal, via butting into his cab fares many affairs.',\n \"watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief, that mike olshanskey's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel

appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors.\",\n 'but i am afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution.',\n 'i thought maybe maybe this could be good.',\n \"an early appearance by the re animator jeffery combs many homage's to old horror movies the troma label on the front this movie could be a gem!\",\n 'i thought wrong.',\n 'frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half assed homage to the fright films of yore.',\n 'the story is an old one, young people breaking into a house, getting drunk, making love, and tampering with things that should not be tampered with.',\n 'the oft \\x96 recycled slasher film formula is used here, this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing.',\n \"in fact, the performance by the radzoff's actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film.\",\n 'he does the snooty dracula style character very well.',\n 'but as for the kids, its not so good, with combs only having a minimal part.',\n 'the film lacks entertainment value, and only features one cool character, and one or two scenes that can hold your attention.',\n 'i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch, and this is the only movie left at blockbuster.',\n \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty three's frightmare is an odd little film.\",\n \"the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classicthirtys'fortys style horror movies with the shock factor of the then explodingeightys slasher genre.\",\n 'it is not totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance classier than the movie deserves by the late german actor ferdinand mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad ratzoff.',\n 'at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he is shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that old conrad is a bit of a hoity toity, prima donna jerk off.',\n 'just when you think he could not be any more un likable, the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death.',\n 'nice, huh?',\n 'conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die.',\n \"still feisty even at death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself.\",\n 'conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.',\n \"it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad's grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party.\",\n 'not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in aneightys horror film.',\n 'logic has no place here.',\n \"the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad's body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning.\",\n \"in the meantime, mrs. ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband's body, has called in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a seance.\",\n 'you can pretty much figure out the rest from here.',\n 'since conrad was not a very nice guy in life, it is not much of a stretch to assume that he will not be any friendlier in death.',\n \"psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one.\",\n 'this is where the movie falls apart.',\n 'endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying hello?',\n 'is anyone there?',\n 'are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thingbut again, we are in aneightys horror film!',\n \"that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs.\",\n 'the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than musicthunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.',\n 'that becomes severely annoying after a while.',\n 'i cannot really recommend frightmare to anyone who did not grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in theeightys.',\n 'modern horror fans will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy.',\n 'if you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from frightmare.',\n 'fans of jeffrey re animator combs may also want to check it out, as the future dr. west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.',\n \"i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label paired with roy ward's vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible.\",\n 'i am told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma, which seems appropriate.',\n 'if you are a troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley.',\n 'i do not get it!',\n 'the teenage leads in horror star supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol conrad radzoff passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it.',\n 'that does not sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it?',\n 'i am a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price, peter cushing and boris karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory.',\n 'no wonder conrad comes back from the dead \\x96 admittedly, after a sance \\x96 to wipe them all off the face of the earth!',\n 'mr. radzoff already was not known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego.',\n 'even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets.',\n 'horror star a.k.a.',\n \"frightmare and body snatchers is a pretty lame eighty's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy gory highlights to enjoy.\",\n 'the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one \\x96 not even a film school student \\x96 is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he will get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through.',\n \"conrad's video speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive.\",\n 'one teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one jeffrey combs in one of his first roles!',\n 'loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence.',\n \"in the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin.\",\n 'writerdirector norman thaddeus vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister.',\n 'the locations and scenery are great, but vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing job.',\n 'the acting performances are overall decent, with ferdy mayne imitating christopher lee and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles.',\n 'horror star can hardly be called a must see or even a good film, but it is worth tracking down in case you are an admirer of enthusiastically made b horror.',\n 'conrad radzoffferdy mayne, a hammy cult icon, dies from a heart ailmentnot before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and tv commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults.',\n 'his body is removed from his mausoleum by some film studentsthey wish to invite him to dinnerthey are quite big fans.',\n 'what these kidsincluding a young jeffrey combsdo not expect is that radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest.',\n \"the list of violent acts include radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face, decapitates one fellow, and cremates another guy alive in a coffin.\",\n \"a really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around radzoff's ghoulish activities.\",\n 'silly hokum from troma is limited by a very, very low budget and slowwwwww pace.',\n 'the film feels a lot longer than it is.',\n 'the film is not really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark.',\n 'at times, radzoff is an ominous presence, yet at other times he just looks real silly.',\n 'one of the last surviving horror screen greats conrad radzoff dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised before death snippets of the great conrad greeting you as you visit.',\n \"unfortunately for him and his captors, conrad's body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with and at him, and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs.\",\n \"news of the missing body reaches radzoff's widow and her friendwho happens to be proficient in the black arts and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings conrad back to life so he can, in his own words, get an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\",\n 'well, frightmare is an interesting bad film.',\n 'sure, it is cheap.',\n 'the sets look like they were borrowedwhich i am sure they were.',\n 'the special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility.',\n 'the acting is average to below average with a few exceptions.',\n \"jeffrey combs of re animator fame is in tow, but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks.\",\n 'none of the kids except the pretty girl playing meg is any good.',\n 'nita talbot plays the friend of the radzoffs with withering interest.',\n 'also, look for the big i mean big guy that plays the policeman.',\n 'that is porky himself of porkys fame.',\n 'but thankfully for all of us, one performance does rise above the material.',\n 'ferdy mayne, an oft overlooked actor from germany who had christopher lee features and did star as a vampire in the fearless vampire killers, does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life.',\n 'conrad radzoff in a bad human being in life, living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even deadobviously none of the swinging teens at that point.',\n 'mayne is able to look very regal, speak very elegantly, and convey menace with ease.',\n 'if for no other reason, one should see frightmare for his performance.',\n 'i do however, believe that when they showed black and white clips of radzoff that they used christopher lee footageanyone have any thoughts?.',\n 'anyway, one can guess what happens and it does indeed radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace.',\n 'again, the formula is trite and overused.',\n 'the acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous.',\n 'but mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude.',\n 'definitely worth a little peek.',\n 'watching mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time.',\n 'my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child.',\n 'we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment.',\n 'this was one such movie, kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child, but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more in depth review.',\n 'the story has some old horror actor legend dying.',\n 'i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price, without being likable and classy.',\n 'he commits murders and dies, but what is this?',\n 'is the movie over already?',\n 'no, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave.',\n 'i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing.',\n 'seemed to have a good premise, but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.',\n 'frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest.',\n 'this icon, who has some christopher lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.',\n 'the first ten minutes is well filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem.',\n 'but the film drags in the middle although thankfully not as much as house of death and never really gets that initial spurt of energy back.',\n 'lots of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things.',\n 'twice we see poisonous gas being used.',\n 'but the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played.',\n 'boy, is that false advertising, unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch matlock.',\n 'the general principle of the film is decent horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon.',\n 'a modern equivalent digging up vincent price or peter cushing would make a great film.',\n 'maybe a remake is in order if that would not be too disrespectful.',\n 'sometimes theory does not come across as well in application, and this film offers that example.',\n 'the only redeeming quality of this film besides the beginning is the brief appearance of a very young jeffrey combs.',\n 'i saw him and thought that is jeffrey combs but felt i was mistaken as the box never mentioned him.',\n 'but sure enough, combs was present.',\n \"a note to this movie's film makers mention combs on the cover of the dvd, you will sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.\",\n 'if you are a jeffrey combs die hard, check out this early role.',\n 'otherwise, i cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon.',\n 'let me suggest intruder or popcorn, as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time.',\n \"it is saturday, it is raining, and i think every movie should have at least one comment so i just watched the crime doctor's courage all the way through.\",\n 'it is a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects each with their own possible motive for the crime.',\n 'the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever.',\n 'i guess that is not too surprising for a b movie of this period.',\n \"there are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre wwii, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.\",\n 'the crime doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some rr from his psychiatry practice on the east coast.',\n 'he hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers.',\n 'the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth aka dr. watson, and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief sort of.',\n 'there is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth.',\n 'and then there are the mysterious braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night club.',\n \"the dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the thirty's than the forty's.\",\n 'though the story location is california, the braggas appear to live in a castle!',\n 'there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused, but i will not divulge any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance.',\n 'even though i can think of many, many, b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent i have not seen any other movies from the crime doctor series, so i cannot make any comparisons.',\n 'i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style, little on substance and originality.',\n 'does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with seventys shag hair and too cool for school clothes?',\n \"plus, this film wallows in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventys chic, which works for some sofia coppola's the virgin suicides comes to mind but not for this director.\",\n \"another reviewer compared this to harmony korine's work and i agree.\",\n 'yet i do not view this as a positive thing what has he done lately, anyway?.',\n 'bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved.',\n 'if you happen to see it late night on cable, turn the channel and watch something else instead.',\n 'acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen clich horror with a more thriller like pacing.',\n 'in some ways acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably.',\n 'overall acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of cabin fever, texas chainsaw massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one by one are plucked off by some sort of monster.',\n 'instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance.',\n 'the characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons.',\n 'in the end you were left with the feeling that there were no and perhaps are no innocent victims.',\n 'as the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority.',\n 'this was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film.',\n 'following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.',\n 'through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of clich, which i suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which i found intriguing.',\n 'this, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.',\n 'technically the film has a lot of problems however.',\n 'the cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, i find rather sophomoric and over stylized, utilizing formulaic twothree approaches far too rigidly.',\n 'many transitions i felt were also over stylized.',\n 'the use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.',\n 'the plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused.',\n 'methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.',\n \"overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.\",\n 'if the film were better executed, it would have been excellent.',\n 'however, acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.',\n 'this was a decent movie for the first half.',\n 'too many cheap boo!',\n 'moments but the tension builds, the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely.',\n 'the kids are not particularly deep but hey, that works for teens.',\n ...]"
