in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment.',\n \"There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle.\",\n 'And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.',\n 'Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging.',\n \"It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.\",\n '\"Ned Kelly\" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it\\'s just the same old story told with different accents.',\n 'This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching

know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.',\n 'This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression.',\n 'I found the film a real chore to watch.',\n 'It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.',\n 'I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and

fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the State Department; they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem.',\n

begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out Vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers.',\n 'The flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpudlian and all retarded.',\n 'All of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.',\n 'Not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape.',\n 'The nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!)',\n 'by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself.',\n \"That he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it's gotta be done at some point, and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera.\",\n 'The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location filming.',\n \"Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making, but he doesn't muck around with sets.\",\n 'You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen.',\n 'This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI sets and backdrops ad nauseam.',\n 'Ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot.',\n \"If you're trying to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you'll be made as restless as I was.\",\n \"If you like Franco, you'll watch this anyway.\",\n \"If you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you'll never come across this film.\",\n \"Copies of it aren't just lying around, and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it.\",\n \"It's Franco.\",\n 'Lazy, crazy Franco.',\n 'I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties.',\n 'I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil.',\n 'Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America.',\n 'They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself \"The Devil\" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy.',\n 'Maidens are Chained up.',\n 'The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner.',\n 'Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,',\n 'As the number of Video Nasties I\\'ve yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.',\n 'The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots.',\n 'Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut.',\n \"He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER!\",\n 'Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood.',\n 'After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour.',\n \"Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it.\",\n 'His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.',\n 'Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity?',\n \"This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans.\",\n 'Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well.',\n 'So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.',\n \"I can't recommend this trash to anyone.\",\n \"It's not even the good bad movie.\",\n \"It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last.\",\n 'If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.',\n ...]"

gold rush,1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie br br the american idea of an untamed frontier, subdued by individual heroes armed with sixguns, was continued in the far country, another story about a cowboy from the american west wyoming this time driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country.\",\n 'the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns \\x96 that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness.',\n 'when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle, the customs shack is empty.br br where is the constable?',\n 'asks brennan.br br up on the pelly

\"they collected customs duties, often over the wails of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation, and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies, or if they simply looked bad.\",\n 'in true canadian fashion, they laid down moral laws for the community.',\n \"in dawson the lord's day act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre, generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.br br in such a community, a gunbelt was unthinkable.\",\n 'one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable, who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly.',\n 'the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over.',\n 'no man has yet taken a gun away from me, said the american.',\n \"well, i'm taking it, the constable said mildly and did so, without further resistance.\",\n \"so

stampede, there wasn't a serious crime \\x96 let alone a murder \\x96 in dawson.\",\n 'the contrast with skagway on the american side, which was a lawless town run by soapy smith, the denver confidence man, was remarkable.',\n 'but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law, which a soapy smith character from skagway \\x96 he is called gannon in the picture \\x96 can

as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film.',\n 'it is almost never in the wrong place, never.',\n 'br br the far country has one amazing moment.',\n 'and as usual it comes from stewart.',\n 'nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man.',\n 'he is absolutely amazing look at him in bend, far, winchester, and man from laramie in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau, in far he is shot off a raft with such violence, it looks so convincing that you wince, and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man, well you find yourself looking for the burn marks.',\n 'what an actor.',\n 'not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room, also as well as anybody ever did it.',\n \"br br but that was mann's territory look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west.\",\n 'as painful as any fight scene ever recorded.',\n 'cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart, nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight.',\n

best ever done by anyone, period.br br thanks, anthony.',\n 'mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion, and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do.',\n 'br br but come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city, yukon to elect themselves a marshal yes a marshal!',\n 'and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town?',\n 'br br nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush.',\n 'mr. mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood, the canadian north for the american wild west.br br canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with

'he is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.br br however, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him.',\n 'he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters cut not that bad.br br still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable.',\n 'walter brennan, royal dano, harry morgan,

way up the ladderand dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight.',\n \"brian krause, who i thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays

is paul parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film.',\n \"the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth.\",\n 'nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way.that is until alison realizes who stanley really is.',\n 'alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject.what motivated stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path?',\n 'the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller.',\n \"of course, you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate.quite a hard pill to swallow.\",\n 'unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director pochih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed.such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slowmotion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on videoand rather annoy instead of impress.',\n \"this sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.\",\n 'return to cabin by the lake just. was lacking.',\n 'it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera.',\n \"so, within the same scene you'll have some moviequality camera shots and simple video camera shots.\",\n 'it makes for a very odd blend!',\n 'i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect!',\n \"br br i think it's worthwhile to see it if you have seen the

movies.br br the aspect of this movie that i really hated, though, was that 9095% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 510 seconds where the footage is shot on video.',\n \"you can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second.\",\n \"i'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why, anyway, but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.br br
