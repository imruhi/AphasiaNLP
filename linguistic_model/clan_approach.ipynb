one falling in love with a younger man.',\n 'Intriguing.',\n 'NOT!',\n 'I hasten to add.',\n 'These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.',\n \"Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.\",\n 'And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives.',\n 'I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???)',\n 'were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette!',\n 'Right.',\n 'Like I said, a shame of a waste.',\n '4 out of 10.',\n '\"The Crush\" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit \"Sex and the City\".',\n \"I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of).\",\n 'They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of \"Sabrina\" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.',\n 'Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor.',\n 'The plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina.',\n \"But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what might really be wrong.\",\n 'Just as with \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is male, here first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie.',\n 'The working title for the film was \"The Sad F*cker\\'s Club\" which would have made its parallels with the gay \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.',\n '(originally written 4/6/2002)',\n 'it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence?',\n \"i don't think so.\",\n 'There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe.',\n \"The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be.\",\n 'Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO

good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...',\n \"***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.\",\n 'True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably.',\n \"Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical.\",\n 'Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera.',\n 'Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.',\n \"Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all.\",\n 'Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility.',\n \"And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve?\",\n \"We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning.\",\n \"Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.\",\n 'Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent.',\n \"He has his character's attitude and it fits him.\",\n

actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie.\",\n \"Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.\",\n \"Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana.\",\n \"I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.\",\n 'This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the \"sex scenes\" is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences.',\n 'It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama.',\n 'Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used?',\n \"Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies

other review posted here and say to people: \"Don\\'t watch it; it\\'s a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry.\"',\n 'And by that I don\\'t mean \"sick and angry\" about \"the human condition\" or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film - \"an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty\" and so on - and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be.',\n \"My beef with the film is rather that I don't see this hours-long record of empty vanity

likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like \"un homme beau comme un film de Nicholas Ray\", he really was just reproducing word-for-word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director Eustache, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film.',\n \"I suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100% of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu.\",\n 'What made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to Alexandre and Veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us.',\n \"If a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping (mostly in this very flat) with another, and running around Paris proposing marriage to yet a third, well, I suppose I can wish him the best of luck in the dog-eat-dog world he's chosen to create for himself.\",\n 'What I can\\'t, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his \"anxiety\" and his \"despair\".',\n 'The same goes double for the even more despicable Veronika, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by Marie and Alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty.',\n 'As I say, if \"La Maman et La Putain\" is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of Alexandre, Veronika and Marie, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then I suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being \"unflinching\" (though why one should even feel like \"flinching\" once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe I can\\'t imagine).',\n \"The problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced - and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics - that Alexander, Veronika and Marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities.\",\n 'This latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense.',\n 'There may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular.',\n 'But the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work.',\n 'It surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like Alexandre is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone,

are quite a few HK stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse.\",\n \"It's just bad.\",\n 'The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long.',\n \"If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot.\",\n \"I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.\",\n '\"Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning.',\n 'But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty?',\n 'Nobody should love that.\"',\n '- Lucius Shepard  \"The Color Purple\" takes place in the Deep South during the early 1900s, and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African American sisters.',\n 'The film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather.',\n 'This motif \\x96 innocence interrupted by men \\x96 permeates the entire film.',\n 'The film then launches into a series of short sequences.',\n 'Celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, clean and look after his children.',\n 'All these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work.',\n 'The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused Stanley Kubrick to remark that \"The Color Purple\" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes.',\n 'Ten minutes?',\n 'He lasted a long time.',\n 'The film is often said to deal which \"racism\", \"sexism\" and \"black culture\", but this is not true.',\n 'Alice Walker, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian.',\n 'Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery, which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women.',\n 'For Walker, the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.',\n \"Spielberg's film, however, re-frames Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies.\",\n 'This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men.',\n 'A film in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool.',\n 'A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins), stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs.',\n 'This is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions.',\n 'A film in which black people are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions.',\n 'A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept.',\n 'This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as derived from \"Gone With The Wind\", MGM Muscals, \"Song of the South\", Warner Cartoons, \"Halleluha!\"',\n 'and banned Disney movies.',\n \"In other words, it's the South as seen by a child raised on 50s TV.\",\n \"It's all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist Ishmael Reed famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.\",\n 'Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed.',\n \"This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.\",\n \"Beyond Walker's hate letter to black men and Spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black life, we are shown nothing of the black community.\",\n 'We have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community.',\n 'Instead, Spielberg\\'s camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention (one of Celie\\'s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a \"Home Alone\" movie), every emotion over played, the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by.',\n 'Couple this with Quincy Jones\\' ridiculously \"white\" music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith, scored by a black man trying to emulate John Williams.',\n 'Problematic too is the lack of white characters.',\n \"Consider this: the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood.\",\n 'No, they are cruel by nature.',\n 'And the women, whether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them.',\n 'A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors, women unable to support themselves and their children alone.',\n \"And so there's a hidden ideology at work here.\",\n \"Late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites.\",\n 'The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them.',\n \"ie- Respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture.\",\n '3/10 - A failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering \"The Color Purple\" worthless.',\n 'You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.',\n \"I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote.\",\n \"(Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about.\",\n 'But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.)',\n 'The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome.',\n 'While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: \"Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered.',\n 'Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life.\"',\n 'This is over-the-top sentimentality.',\n 'When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found?',\n \"There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on.\",\n 'Nothing rings true.',\n 'I even wondered if Harpo\\'s name was chosen purposefully because it\\'s his wife Sophia\\'s real name, \"Oprah,\" backwards.',\n 'Spielberg isn\\'t above such \"cuteness.\"',\n \"It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion.\",\n \"Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.\",\n 'This is really terrible.',\n 'The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched, I would have a suitable reply.',\n 'I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell.',\n \"I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix.\",\n 'Let me debunk the myths and lies.',\n 'There is nothing good in the movie.',\n 'Everything yells tacky.',\n 'The actress is ugly.',\n 'The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen.',\n 'The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish.',\n \"Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten.\",\n 'Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.',\n 'I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before.',\n 'Unforgivable.',\n 'Dude, really!!!!',\n 'where have you guys been the past 20 years, this is shocking in all kind of ways, horror ?',\n \"This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, If you want to look at the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay etc.\",\n \"Total waist of money and free time, have watched a lot of movies, were as horror is my all time favorite, I really am speechless, have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft, please understand\",\n 'Well, you know the rest!',\n \"This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long long time.\",\n 'I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role.',\n 'The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.',\n \"Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques.\",\n \"This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch.\",\n 'An average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing.',\n \"Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year.\",\n \"I'm in Iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies.\",\n \"We also have access to plenty of pirated movies, this gem came along with 11 other movies, and this is easily the worst I've seen in a long time.\",\n \"I've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but really, I think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible.\",\n \"It's not tongue in cheek, the writers really thought they were improving on the movie Blade.\",\n \"This movie is just one notch above Vampire Assassin, which if you haven't seen, i recommend.\",\n \"At least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible.\",\n 'This is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever.',\n 'from the bad acting, to cliché visual (ie opening credits), to the adobe premier special effects.',\n \"they couldn't even get blanks for the guns, which may have to do with where the movie was filmed, but if you're going to use effects, make them close to accurate.\",\n 'as for the cast, it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out.',\n \"Once again, like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin, don't let stunt folk act, they can't.\",\n 'Also, the comment about this being a \"return of old vampire movies\"...no, it\\'s not.',\n 'This is exactly what all new vampire movies are about.',\n \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, they're all about some super star fighting the vampires.\",\n 'This is the newest vampire genre, with bad blood, fake screams, and cheesy over acting.',\n 'obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie, or friends of the cast.',\n 'But what do I care, I paid 33 cents for it.',\n \"Anyway, to wrap this up, someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie, I give them credit because it's better than I could do.\",\n \"Of course I also know I can't make movies so I don't try.\",\n 'I do know how to watch movies though.',\n \"I work 12 hour nights, 6 days a week, I've seen several thousand in the year I've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack.\",\n '\"Valentine\" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think \"Halloween\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"Scream\", and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\").',\n 'It certainly isn\\'t as good as those movies that I have listed about, but it\\'s better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first \"Friday the 13th\" film.',\n 'One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made \"My Bloody Valentine\", which I hated alot.',\n '\"Valentine\" is a better film than that one, but it\\'s not saying much.',\n 'The plot: a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film.',\n \"Then the film moves years later
