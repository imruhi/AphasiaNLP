time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives.',\n 'I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those

of).\",\n 'They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of \"Sabrina\" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.',\n 'Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor.',\n

City,\" the writer/director is male, here first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie.',\n 'The working title for the film was \"The Sad F*cker\\'s Club\"

the main cast fails miserably.',\n \"Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical.\",\n 'Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera.',\n 'Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.',\n \"Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all.\",\n

on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve?\",\n \"We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning.\",\n \"Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character

actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie.\",\n \"Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.\",\n \"Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a

acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences.',\n 'It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama.',\n 'Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used?',\n \"Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies

and angry\" about \"the human condition\" or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film - \"an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty\" and so on - and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be.',\n \"My beef with the film is rather that I don't see this hours-long record of empty vanity

likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like \"un homme beau comme un film de Nicholas Ray\", he really was just reproducing word-for-word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director Eustache, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film.',\n \"I suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100% of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu.\",\n 'What made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to Alexandre and Veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us.',\n \"If a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping (mostly in this very flat) with another, and running around Paris proposing marriage to yet a third, well, I suppose I can wish him the best of luck in the dog-eat-dog world he's chosen to create for himself.\",\n 'What I can\\'t, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his \"anxiety\" and his \"despair\".',\n 'The same goes double for the even more despicable Veronika, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by Marie and Alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty.',\n 'As I say, if \"La Maman et La Putain\" is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of Alexandre, Veronika and Marie, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then I suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being \"unflinching\" (though why one should even feel like \"flinching\" once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe I can\\'t imagine).',\n \"The problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced - and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics - that Alexander, Veronika and Marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities.\",\n 'This latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense.',\n 'There may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular.',\n 'But the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work.',\n 'It surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like Alexandre is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone,

good character development) not this film.\",\n 'Beware you will be disappointed.',\n \"Zu Warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid.The movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something.Whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical God /Demon/Wizard thing.The plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie.The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying,princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something.Even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like (yes that's a word!\",\n \").I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand....who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all.It felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time.I can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching Inu-Yasha at episode 134 drunk...yeah that's right you don't know what the hell is going on.Don't waste your brain trying to figure this out.\",\n

the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'Insomnia'.\",\n 'When it\\'s first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought \"Wow!',\n 'A nihilistic martial arts film!\"',\n

sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long.',\n \"If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot.\",\n \"I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.\",\n '\"Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning.',\n 'But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty?',\n 'Nobody should love that.\"',\n '- Lucius Shepard \"The Color Purple\" takes place in the Deep South during the early 1900s, and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African American sisters.',\n 'The film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather.',\n 'This motif \\x96 innocence interrupted by men \\x96 permeates the entire film.',\n 'The film then launches into a series of short sequences.',\n 'Celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, clean and look after his children.',\n 'All these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work.',\n 'The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused Stanley Kubrick to remark that \"The Color Purple\" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes.',\n 'Ten minutes?',\n 'He lasted a long time.',\n 'The film is often said to deal which \"racism\", \"sexism\" and \"black culture\", but this is not true.',\n 'Alice Walker, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian.',\n 'Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery, which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women.',\n 'For Walker, the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.',\n \"Spielberg's film, however, re-frames Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies.\",\n 'This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men.',\n 'A film in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool.',\n 'A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins), stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs.',\n 'This is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions.',\n 'A film in which black people are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions.',\n 'A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept.',\n 'This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as derived from \"Gone With The Wind\", MGM Muscals, \"Song of the South\", Warner Cartoons, \"Halleluha!\"',\n 'and banned Disney movies.',\n \"In other words, it's the South as seen by a child raised on 50s TV.\",\n \"It's all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist Ishmael Reed famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.\",\n 'Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed.',\n \"This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.\",\n \"Beyond Walker's hate letter to black men and Spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black life, we are shown nothing of the black community.\",\n 'We have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community.',\n 'Instead, Spielberg\\'s camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention (one of Celie\\'s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a \"Home Alone\" movie), every emotion over played, the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by.',\n 'Couple this with Quincy Jones\\' ridiculously \"white\" music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith, scored by a black man trying to emulate John Williams.',\n 'Problematic too is the lack of white characters.',\n \"Consider this: the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood.\",\n 'No, they are cruel by nature.',\n 'And the women, whether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them.',\n 'A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors, women unable to support themselves and their children alone.',\n \"And so there's a hidden ideology at work here.\",\n \"Late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites.\",\n 'The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them.',\n \"ie- Respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture.\",\n '3/10 - A failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering \"The Color Purple\" worthless.',\n 'You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.',\n \"I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote.\",\n \"(Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about.\",\n 'But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.)',\n 'The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome.',\n 'While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: \"Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered.',\n 'Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life.\"',\n 'This is over-the-top sentimentality.',\n 'When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found?',\n \"There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on.\",\n 'Nothing rings true.',\n 'I even wondered if Harpo\\'s name was chosen purposefully because it\\'s his wife Sophia\\'s real name, \"Oprah,\" backwards.',\n 'Spielberg isn\\'t above such \"cuteness.\"',\n \"It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion.\",\n \"Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.\",\n 'This is really terrible.',\n 'The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched, I would have a suitable reply.',\n 'I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell.',\n \"I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix.\",\n 'Let me debunk the myths and lies.',\n 'There is nothing good in the movie.',\n 'Everything yells tacky.',\n 'The actress is ugly.',\n 'The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen.',\n 'The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish.',\n \"Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten.\",\n 'Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.',\n 'I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before.',\n 'Unforgivable.',\n 'Dude, really!!!!',\n 'where have you guys been the past 20 years, this is shocking in all kind of ways, horror ?',\n \"This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, If you want to look at the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay etc.\",\n \"Total waist of money and

role.',\n 'The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.',\n \"Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques.\",\n \"This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts,

genre that all too often makes its living by distorting, rather than retelling, history.',\n \"along with some fairly decent set design, valentina cervi's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development.\",\n 'unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot, and does not, sustain this movie.',\n 'the acting is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two.',\n 'the cinematography is ok, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distortedlens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama.',\n \"in any event, the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia's body, and all too seldom on her paintings.br br all told, a nearcomplete failure.\",\n \"it's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as softcore pornography.\",\n 'so the french can fail, after all!',\n 'it figures this is a french film, lol, with the emphasis on young girls with much older men.why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing?',\n 'when the age difference is this great, it really comes off as pervy!',\n \"valentina cervi is beautiful she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey, of zeffirelli's'68 romeo and

record unusually detailed in this case of the real artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period 17th century.\",\n 'her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the ageold accusation that all great artists were men she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant.',\n \"not only was she clearly assaulted, and forced into a degrading sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame, but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child.br br the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up because in some weird frencified way, it's hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather.\",\n \"that's sexy the truth is boring and seems too feministpolitically correct.br br it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film.\",\n \"the fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after, not before the rape, that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy, that she went on to have children.oh that's boring stuff.\",\n \"after all, that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't hot like teenagers.br br i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character.\",\n 'you need to create dialog, have subplots, create dramatic structure.',\n \"certainly some details can be sacrificed it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years, or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette.and a big boned one, not a skinny minny, or something like that.\",\n 'but to turn her story around on her, and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing.',\n \"it's even worse because the director is female.\",\n 'she should be horribly ashamed of herself!br

catherine mccormack.',\n 'similarly based on heavily rewritten history, with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit!',\n \"any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story, it's annoying.\",\n 'those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on.',\n \"for this reason we often talk of the story jumping through hoops as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion.br br the story in comet over broadway doesn't just jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus.\",\n \"it's so ludicrous, so illconceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through.br br the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession.\",\n \"since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion.\",\n \"so, in the end there's no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor
