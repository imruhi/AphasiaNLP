this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage.',\n 'Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.',\n \"There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.\",\n \"But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.\",\n 'I had it as a Xmas gift, as it\\'s a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \"A Time to kill\" , and the \"The Newton Boys \" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.',\n \"However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.\",\n \"The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.\",\n 'So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I\\'ve seen, I\\'d recommend, \"A Time to kill\" , \"The Newton Boys \" \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\" and \"Amistad\" and avoid too \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.',\n \"As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.\",\n \"When a man who doesn't have Alzheimer's can't remember how many films he's made, he probably is the world's most prolific director after all.\",\n \"That man is Jesus Franco, the king of so-called 'eurotrash'.\",\n \"His 1980 flick Devil Hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading, for starters) as any other Franco film I've seen.\",\n 'That makes it sound pretty awful, and it is...',\n 'Yet Franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made.',\n \"The mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious.\",\n 'Devil Hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour.',\n 'The kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in South America.',\n \"There's lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole.\",\n \"You need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are Franco's main methods of extending a film out to feature length.\",\n 'The monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary.',\n 'He has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber.',\n \"Early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here but I think he ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!).\",\n 'Anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out Vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers.',\n 'The flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpudlian and all retarded.',\n 'All of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.',\n 'Not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape.',\n 'The nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!)',\n 'by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself.',\n \"That he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it's gotta be done at some point, and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera.\",\n 'The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location filming.',\n \"Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making, but he doesn't muck around with sets.\",\n 'You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen.',\n 'This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI sets and backdrops ad nauseam.',\n 'Ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot.',\n \"If you're trying to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you'll be made as restless as I was.\",\n \"If you like Franco, you'll watch this anyway.\",\n \"If you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you'll never come across this film.\",\n \"Copies of it aren't just lying around, and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it.\",\n \"It's Franco.\",\n 'Lazy, crazy Franco.',\n 'I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties.',\n 'I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil.',\n 'Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America.',\n 'They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself \"The Devil\" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy.',\n 'Maidens are Chained up.',\n 'The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner.',\n 'Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,',\n 'As the number of Video Nasties I\\'ve yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.',\n 'The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots.',\n 'Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut.',\n \"He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER!\",\n 'Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood.',\n 'After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour.',\n \"Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it.\",\n 'His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.',\n 'Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity?',\n \"This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans.\",\n 'Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well.',\n 'So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.',\n \"I can't recommend this trash to anyone.\",\n \"It's not even the good bad movie.\",\n \"It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last.\",\n 'If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.',\n ...]"

is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you have seen your share before.',\n 'the plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound.',\n 'many of the characters are heavily stereotyped the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the mexican in a hollywood movie from the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys.',\n 'all passably acted but again

better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films.',\n 'parts of the plot do not make sense and seem to be added in to use up time.',\n 'the end plot is that of a very basic type that does not leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning.',\n \"the end scene with the flask backs do not make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character.\",\n 'not really worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the

jack has a more personal reason for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.',\n 'after until death, van damme appeared to be on a high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market.',\n 'while that was a far more drama oriented film, with the shepherd he has returned to the high kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since derailed.',\n 'it is nowhere near as bad as that film, but what i said still stands.',\n 'a dull, predictable film, with very little in the way of any exciting action.',\n 'what little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo mosped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate.',\n 'being a mexican set film, director isaac florentine has tried to give the film a robert rodriguezdesperado sort of feel, but this only adds to the desperation.',\n 'vd gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he is never been a robert de niro sort of actor, that cannot be good.',\n 'as the villain, lord should not expect to leave the beeb anytime soon.',\n 'he gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an american accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end.',\n 'all the supporting cast are equally bland, and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.',\n 'this is one shepherd that is strayed right from the flock.',\n 'first off let me say, if you have not enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie.',\n 'most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are.',\n 'this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years.',\n 'van damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans.',\n 'it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but, in my opinion it is worth watching.',\n 'it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run.',\n 'good fun stuff!',\n \"i had high hopes for this one until they changed the name tothe shepherd border patrol, the lamest movie name ever, what was wrong with justthe

soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame.',\n \"there is one great line aboutbeing pss drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some ok action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all.\",\n 'a lot of the times the dialogue does not match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot.',\n 'the end fight is one of the better van damme fights except the director tries to go a bit too john woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van damme film.',\n 'not good, not bad, just average generic action.',\n 'isaac florentine has made some of the best western martial arts action movies ever produced.',\n 'in particular us seals two, cold harvest, special forces and undisputed two are all action classics.',\n 'you can tell isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for.',\n 'in particular he has found a muse with scott adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for.',\n 'this is borne out with special forces and undisputed two, but unfortunately the shepherd just does not live up to their abilities.',\n 'there is no doubt that jcvd looks better here fight wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has for pretty much no reason in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with scott, but look in his eyes.',\n 'jcvd seems to be dead inside.',\n 'there is nothing in his eyes at all.',\n 'it is like he just does not care about anything throughout the whole film.',\n 'and this is the leading man.',\n 'there are other dodgy aspects to the film, script wise and visually, but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film.',\n 'a genuine shame as i know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been.',\n 'there are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves.',\n 'this film had a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opponent for jcvd to face down.',\n 'this could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls out action movie stakes.',\n 'sincerely a shame that this did not happen.',\n 'it actually pains me to say it, but this movie was horrible on every level.',\n 'the blame does not lie entirely with van damme as you can see he tried his best, but let us face it, he is almost fifty, how much more can you ask of him?',\n 'i find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together undisputed two arguably the best western martial arts movie in years, created this.',\n 'everything from the plot, to the dialog, to the editing, to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical.',\n 'scott adkins who is fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel, was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because one he is more than capable of playing that role and two the actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying.',\n 'again, not blaming van damme.',\n 'i will always be a fan, but avoid this one.',\n \"technically i'am a van damme fan, or i was.\",\n 'this movie is so bad that i hated myself for wasting those ninety minutes.',\n 'do not let the name isaac florentine undisputed ii fool you, i had big hopes for this one, depending on what i saw in undisputed ii, man was i wrong?',\n \"all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero, but i guess we will not be able to see that soon, as our hero keep coming with those going to a border far away town and kill the bad guys than comeback home movies i mean for god's sake, we are in two thousand and eight, and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level.\",\n 'why?',\n 'do your self a favor, skip it seriously.',\n 'honestly awful film, bad editing, awful lighting, dire dialog and scrappy screenplay.',\n 'the lighting at is so bad there is moments you cannot even see what is going on, i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that did not help.',\n 'they must have found the script in a bin, the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low.',\n \"you cannot even laugh at the cheesy'ness.\",\n 'the directing and editing are also terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it is just unreal.',\n \"there is not a lot else to say other than it is really bad and nothing like jean claude van damme's earlier work which you could enjoy.\",\n 'avoid like the plaque, frankly words fail me in condemning this film.',\n \"this flick is a waste of time.i expect from an action movie to have more than two explosions and some shooting.van damme's acting is awful.\",\n 'he never was much of an actor, but here it is worse.he was definitely better in his earlier movies.',\n 'his screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners.the whole dialog in the film is a disaster, same as the plot.the title the shepherd makes no sense.',\n 'why did not they just call it border patrol?',\n 'the fighting scenes could have been better, but either they were not able to afford it, or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas.this is a cheap low type of action cinema.',\n 'blind date columbia pictures, one thousand, nine hundred and thirty four, was a decent film, but i have a few issues with this film.',\n 'first of all, i do not fault the actors in this film at all, but more or less, i have a problem with the script.',\n \"also, i understand that this film was made in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's and people were looking to escape reality, but the script made ann sothern's character look weak.\",\n \"she kept going back and forth between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly's character in the end.\",\n 'he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time.',\n \"paul kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty ann sothern as opposed to neil hamilton, while he did like her a lot, i did not see the depth of love that he had for her character.\",\n 'the production values were great, but the script could have used a little work.',\n \"i first watched this movie back in the midlate eighty's, when i was a kid.\",\n 'we could not even get all the way through it.',\n 'the dialog, the acting, everything about it was just beyond lame.',\n

told us about any survivalists!',\n 'this movie was so bad, my sister and i rented it again for her sixteenth birthday party, just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was.',\n 'i do not think we were able to finish it then either!',\n 'i saw the mogul video vhs of this.',\n 'that is another one of those old one thousand, nine hundred and eightys distributors whose catalog i wish i had!',\n 'this movie was pretty poor.',\n 'though retitled do not look in the attic, the main admonition that is repeated in this is do not go to the villa.',\n 'just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea.',\n 'a character does not go into the attic until an hour into the movie, and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there.',\n 'the movie starts in

woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it.',\n 'she flees the villa, and after she is left a chair moves by itself what is the point of that?',\n 'but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earth.',\n 'from there, it is the present day, thirty years later.',\n 'there is a sance that appears suddenly and does not appear to have anything to do with the movie.',\n 'the children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house.',\n 'the main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother.',\n 'at least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too.',\n 'she is haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, since if they do not use it, they forfeit it.',\n 'people die.',\n 'a lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little.',\n 'the ending is pretty poor.',\n 'why was the family cursed?',\n 'an unfortunately boring movie.',\n \"there is an amusing small

this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different.',\n 'it is true, sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie.',\n 'i also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale, in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that.',\n 'a group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited, but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each other.',\n 'you have seen it all before, and this one is too low budget and slow paced to be scary, and does not have any real surprises in the climax.',\n 'no special effects or gore to speak of, in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the english dubbing, which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie.',\n \"three out of ten, pretty low in the pecking order of eighty's haunted house movies.\",\n 'now, i love italian horror films.',\n 'the cheesier they are, the better.',\n 'however, this is not cheesy italian.',\n 'this is week old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs.',\n 'it is amateur hour on every level.',\n 'there is no suspense, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film.',\n 'the special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost or whatever it was supposed to be is around, and a string pulling bed sheets up and down.',\n 'oooh, can you feel the chills?',\n 'the dvd quality is that of a vhs transfer which actually helps the film more than hurts it.',\n 'the dubbing is below even the lowest bad italian movie standards and i gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious!',\n 'and what do we discover when she finally does look in the attic in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the nextwell, i will not spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let us just say that it is not very novel!',\n 'this cheap, grainy filmed italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.',\n 'i was not impressed by this.',\n 'it was not really that scary, mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be.',\n \"a girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason i could not figure out why and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place.\",\n 'characters come in and out of the film, and it is quite boring at points, and the majority of deaths are quite rushed.',\n 'the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy i could not figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe i just do not remember goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off.',\n 'hate to give away the ending, but oh well.',\n 'the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later.',\n 'the end.',\n 'you really are not missing anything, and anyway, you probably will not find this anywhere, so lucky you.',\n 'i just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that i did not enjoy it a bit.',\n 'it is so slow slow and uninteresting.',\n 'this kid from harry potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother, and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady.',\n 'and this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about girls, driving car and life!',\n 'i could not get how an eighteen year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her eightys.',\n 'sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it, i could be wrong as i am not british and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life.',\n 'mostly the movie is made for the british audience.',\n 'ben,

mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness.',\n 'of course it is corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it, too and walters, who could sleep walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted, is excellent.',\n 'it is when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character, like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink, that she is at her best.',\n 'the problem is she is the only interesting character in the film and it is not because of the script which does not do anybody any favours.',\n \"grint, on the other hand, is not just unhappy he is a bit of a bore as well while linney's starched bitch is completely one dimensional.\",\n 'still, she is got the english accent off pat.',\n 'the best that can be said for it is that it is mildly enjoyable with the emphasis on the mildly.',\n \"every movie i have ppv'd because leonard maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks!\",\n 'every single one!',\n 'when will i

but, unfortunately, she did not die.',\n 'it should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this!',\n 'without harry potter to kick him around, rupert grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of its sockets.',\n \"julie walters's scenery chewing especially the scene when she plays god is even more shameless than her character.\",\n 'at least this harold bangs some bimbo instead of maude.',\n 'for that, i am truly grateful.',\n 'and if you are reading this mr. maltin, you owe me $three.ninety nine!',\n 'low budget horror movie.',\n 'if you do not raise your expectations too high, you will probably enjoy this little flick.',\n 'beginning and end are pretty good, middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot.',\n 'quite a bit of gore.',\n \"i enjoyed bill mcghee's performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture, he managed

obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd i wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be.',\n 'we are beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out, almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel, sentenced to redeem himself from sins, both venial and

'frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half assed homage to the fright films of yore.',\n 'the story is an old one, young people breaking into a house, getting drunk, making love, and tampering with things that should not be tampered with.',\n 'the oft \\x96 recycled slasher film formula is used here, this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing.',\n \"in fact, the performance by the radzoff's actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film.\",\n 'he does the snooty dracula style character very well.',\n 'but as for the kids, its not so good, with combs only having a minimal part.',\n 'the film lacks entertainment value, and only features one cool character, and one or two scenes that can hold your attention.',\n 'i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch, and this is the only movie left at blockbuster.',\n \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty three's frightmare is an odd little film.\",\n \"the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classicthirtys'fortys style horror movies with the shock factor of the then explodingeightys slasher genre.\",\n 'it is not totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance classier than the movie deserves by the late german actor ferdinand mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad ratzoff.',\n 'at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he is shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that old conrad is a bit of a hoity toity, prima donna jerk off.',\n 'just when you think he could not be any more un likable, the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death.',\n 'nice, huh?',\n 'conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die.',\n \"still feisty even at death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself.\",\n 'conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.',\n \"it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad's grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party.\",\n 'not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in aneightys horror film.',\n 'logic has no place here.',\n \"the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad's body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning.\",\n \"in the meantime, mrs. ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband's body, has called in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a seance.\",\n 'you can pretty much figure out the rest from here.',\n 'since conrad was not a very nice guy in life, it is not much of a stretch to assume that he will not be any friendlier in death.',\n \"psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one.\",\n 'this is where the movie falls apart.',\n 'endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying hello?',\n 'is anyone there?',\n 'are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thingbut again, we are in aneightys horror film!',\n \"that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs.\",\n 'the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than musicthunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.',\n 'that becomes severely annoying after a while.',\n 'i cannot really recommend frightmare to anyone who did not grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in theeightys.',\n 'modern horror fans will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy.',\n 'if you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from frightmare.',\n 'fans of jeffrey re animator combs may also want to check it out, as the future dr. west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.',\n \"i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label paired with roy ward's vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible.\",\n 'i am told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma, which seems appropriate.',\n 'if you are a troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley.',\n 'i do not get it!',\n 'the teenage leads in horror star supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol conrad radzoff passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it.',\n 'that does not sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it?',\n 'i am a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price, peter cushing and boris karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory.',\n 'no wonder conrad comes back from the dead \\x96 admittedly, after a sance \\x96 to wipe them all off the face of the earth!',\n 'mr. radzoff already was not known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego.',\n 'even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets.',\n 'horror star a.k.a.',\n \"frightmare and body snatchers is a pretty lame eighty's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy gory highlights to enjoy.\",\n 'the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one \\x96 not even a film school student \\x96 is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he will get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through.',\n \"conrad's video speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive.\",\n 'one teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one jeffrey combs in one of his first roles!',\n 'loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence.',\n \"in the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin.\",\n 'writerdirector norman thaddeus vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister.',\n 'the locations and scenery are great, but vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing job.',\n 'the acting performances are overall decent, with ferdy mayne imitating christopher lee and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles.',\n 'horror star can hardly be called a must see or even a good film, but it is worth tracking down in case you are an admirer of enthusiastically made b horror.',\n 'conrad radzoffferdy mayne, a hammy cult icon, dies from a heart ailmentnot before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and tv commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults.',\n 'his body is removed from his mausoleum by some film studentsthey wish to invite him to dinnerthey are quite big fans.',\n 'what these kidsincluding a young jeffrey combsdo not expect is that radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest.',\n \"the list of violent acts include radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face, decapitates one fellow, and cremates another guy alive in a coffin.\",\n \"a really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around radzoff's ghoulish activities.\",\n 'silly hokum from troma is limited by a very, very low budget and slowwwwww pace.',\n 'the film feels a lot longer than it is.',\n 'the film is not really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark.',\n 'at times, radzoff is an ominous presence, yet at other times he just looks real silly.',\n 'one of the last surviving horror screen greats conrad radzoff dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised before death snippets of the great conrad greeting you as you visit.',\n \"unfortunately for him and his captors, conrad's body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with and at him, and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs.\",\n \"news of the missing body reaches radzoff's widow and her friendwho happens to be proficient in the black arts and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings conrad back to life so he can, in his own words, get an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\",\n 'well, frightmare is an interesting bad film.',\n 'sure, it is cheap.',\n 'the sets look like they were borrowedwhich i am sure they were.',\n 'the special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility.',\n 'the acting is average to below average with a few exceptions.',\n \"jeffrey combs of re animator fame is in tow, but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks.\",\n 'none of the kids except the pretty girl playing meg is any good.',\n 'nita talbot plays the friend of the radzoffs with withering interest.',\n 'also, look for the big i mean big guy that plays the policeman.',\n 'that is porky himself of porkys fame.',\n 'but thankfully for all of us, one performance does rise above the material.',\n 'ferdy mayne, an oft overlooked actor from germany who had christopher lee features and did star as a vampire in the fearless vampire killers, does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life.',\n 'conrad radzoff in a bad human being in life, living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even deadobviously none of the swinging teens at that point.',\n 'mayne is able to look very regal, speak very elegantly, and convey menace with ease.',\n 'if for no other reason, one should see frightmare for his performance.',\n 'i do however, believe that when they showed black and white clips of radzoff that they used christopher lee footageanyone have any thoughts?.',\n 'anyway, one can guess what happens and it does indeed radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace.',\n 'again, the formula is trite and overused.',\n 'the acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous.',\n 'but mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude.',\n 'definitely worth a little peek.',\n 'watching mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time.',\n 'my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child.',\n 'we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment.',\n 'this was one such movie, kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child, but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more in depth review.',\n 'the story has some old horror actor legend dying.',\n 'i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price, without being likable and classy.',\n 'he commits murders and dies, but what is this?',\n 'is the movie over already?',\n 'no, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave.',\n 'i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing.',\n 'seemed to have a good premise, but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.',\n 'frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest.',\n 'this icon, who has some christopher lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.',\n 'the first ten minutes is well filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem.',\n 'but the film drags in the middle although thankfully not as much as house of death and never really gets that initial spurt of energy back.',\n 'lots of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things.',\n 'twice we see poisonous gas being used.',\n 'but the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played.',\n 'boy, is that false advertising, unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch matlock.',\n 'the general principle of the film is decent horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon.',\n 'a modern equivalent digging up vincent price or peter cushing would make a great film.',\n 'maybe a remake is in order if that would not be too disrespectful.',\n 'sometimes theory does not come across as well in application, and this film offers that example.',\n 'the only redeeming quality of this film besides the beginning is the brief appearance of a very young jeffrey combs.',\n 'i saw him and thought that is jeffrey combs but felt i was mistaken as the box never mentioned him.',\n 'but sure enough, combs was present.',\n \"a note to this movie's film makers mention combs on the cover of the dvd, you will sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.\",\n 'if you are a jeffrey combs die hard, check out this early role.',\n 'otherwise, i cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon.',\n 'let me suggest intruder or popcorn, as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time.',\n \"it is saturday, it is raining, and i think every movie should have at least one comment so i just watched the crime doctor's courage all the way through.\",\n 'it is a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects each with their own possible motive for the crime.',\n 'the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever.',\n 'i guess that is not too surprising for a b movie of this period.',\n \"there are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre wwii, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.\",\n 'the crime doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some rr from his psychiatry practice on the east coast.',\n 'he hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers.',\n 'the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth aka dr. watson, and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief sort of.',\n 'there is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth.',\n 'and then there are the mysterious braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night club.',\n \"the dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the thirty's than the forty's.\",\n 'though the story location is california, the braggas appear to live in a castle!',\n 'there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused, but i will not divulge any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance.',\n 'even though i can think of many, many, b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent i have not seen any other movies from the crime doctor series, so i cannot make any comparisons.',\n 'i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style, little on substance and originality.',\n 'does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with seventys shag hair and too cool for school clothes?',\n \"plus, this film wallows in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventys chic, which works for some sofia coppola's the virgin suicides comes to mind but not for this director.\",\n \"another reviewer compared this to harmony korine's work and i agree.\",\n 'yet i do not view this as a positive thing what has he done lately, anyway?.',\n 'bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved.',\n 'if you happen to see it late night on cable, turn the channel and watch something else instead.',\n 'acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen clich horror with a more thriller like pacing.',\n 'in some ways acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably.',\n 'overall acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of cabin fever, texas chainsaw massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one by one are plucked off by some sort of monster.',\n 'instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance.',\n 'the characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons.',\n 'in the end you were left with the feeling that there were no and perhaps are no innocent victims.',\n 'as the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority.',\n 'this was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film.',\n 'following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.',\n 'through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of clich, which i suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which i found intriguing.',\n 'this, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.',\n 'technically the film has a lot of problems however.',\n 'the cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, i find rather sophomoric and over stylized, utilizing formulaic twothree approaches far too rigidly.',\n 'many transitions i felt were also over stylized.',\n 'the use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.',\n 'the plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused.',\n 'methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.',\n \"overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.\",\n 'if the film were better executed, it would have been excellent.',\n 'however, acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.',\n 'this was a decent movie for the first half.',\n 'too many cheap boo!',\n 'moments but the tension builds, the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely.',\n 'the kids are not particularly deep but hey, that works for teens.',\n ...]"
