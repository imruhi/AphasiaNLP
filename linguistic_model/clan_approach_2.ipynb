    "##### NOTE: In CLAN the C-NNLA command was used to get the distribution parameters. However, error outputs from C-NNLA were not very useful (like % correct ..., % incorrect, % grammatical etc) since some CHA files do not annotate errors like [* p], [* s] (but just replace it with xxx, yyy, zzz), making those measures unreliable\n",

a few times.',\n 'So, what was I to do except fulfilling his demand?',\n 'Baking (not only pies), is a cooking method where tools DO actually make the man, which means that it is very hard or nearly impossible to do it successfully without proper bakeware.',\n 'With years of experience under my belt, I’ve learned about and discovered what truly matters when looking for bakeware to buy, and I am going to teach you later in the article.',\n 'Also, I have reviewed what I believe to be the best five non-stick bakeware sets out there, so make sure to check them out if you are in search of one.',\n 'The first and most obvious reason is – because food doesn’t stick to it!',\n 'I do not want to sound overly simplistic, but any chef (or mom, as a matter of fact) knows that pans that stick will absolutely mess up the outcome.',\n 'People normally solve this problem by oiling up, but I don’t like it since it makes the food greasy.',\n 'Using non-stick bakeware is a healthier, more convenient, and more practical way of baking.',\n 'The next thing that you might not have known is that non-stick bakeware is so much easier to clean than more conventional types.',\n 'It is a no-brainer really – if nothing sticks to the surface then there won’t be anything to scrub, scrape or wash off.',\n 'This trait right here will save you tons of time as well as frustration, and it might motivate you to bake more often because of the hassle-free cleaning process.',\n 'Just make sure to maintain the bakeware.',\n '\\u200bLastly, even heat distribution is another thing that you should look for, and this type of bakeware enables it.',\n \"Here's the deal: heat distribution most likely won't affect the quality of the result, but it will make the bakeware heat up more quickly which will ultimately decrease the cooking time.\",\n 'Investing a little bit of time into research can save you a lot of money and trouble in the long run, and that is why you need to read this section carefully.',\n 'Bakeware sets differ regarding materials, abilities, cost, and maintenance, so learning about some general features of these products will help you decide which type will fulfill your demands.',\n 'Bakeware can be made from different kinds of materials including iron, glass, copper, steel, etc.',\n 'Today I will mention only the types that are related to products I reviewed in this article.',\n 'It is important to know that each material yields different cooking properties so study these paragraphs to find out which one is right for you.',\n 'Carbon steel – this material is light, durable, and reacts to temperature changes very quickly, meaning that it can heat up fast.',\n \"Even though is lightweight, it is a bit heavier than copper and doesn't retain heat as well as iron.\",\n \"It's a good choice for baking meats, veggies, bread, and cakes.\",\n 'Copper – it is an excellent heat conductor and doesn’t need pre-heating since it gets hot very quickly.',\n 'Very light, but also quite expensive compared to other bakeware materials.',\n 'Also, it isn’t the best choice for recipes that require baking under very high heat.',\n 'Silicon – good for foods where sticking is an issue, such as breads, cookies, and cakes.',\n 'It is light, affordable and dishes will slide out of it easily.',\n 'The one downside is that it can be frustrating to wash because it is so elastic, but luckily, most of the silicon bakeware is dishwasher safe.',\n 'Since you’ll be buying an entire set of products, it would be a good idea to find one that is suitable for all kinds of baking jobs.',\n 'Make sure that all the basic items such as pie pan, muffin pan, loaf pan, cookie sheet, cake pan, or whatever you need, is included in the package.',\n 'This is a feature that most folks overlook, and it makes a world of difference when it comes to handling the pan.',\n \"It's easy to move the dish around when it's cold but taking it out of a scorching hot oven is a different story (trust me, I know).\",\n 'You’ll try to be cautious not to burn your fingers so it is easy not to pay attention to the contents of the pan which can lead to spillage and a messy kitchen.',\n 'Look for bakeware that has nice, ergonomic handles or handling areas.',\n 'Some models have silicon added to these parts for extra protection and ease of use.',\n 'Not all types of bakeware can withstand the same temperatures; as a matter of fact, this trait greatly differs from product to product.',\n 'Certain pans are oven safe to up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while others cannot take more than 350.',\n 'This is a significant difference so pay close attention to this detail when buying a set.',\n 'Now, let’s get into the meaty part of this article – the reviews.',\n 'After trying out many sets, I’ve reached some conclusions and decided to put together a list of my favorite ones.',\n 'Keep in mind that these are my personal choices, but they are also top rated products.',\n 'Rachel Ray is a world-renowned chef and TV personality, and her famous Cucina line of products never fails to deliver.',\n 'Here, we are dealing with an excellent, 10-piece set that I personally think very highly of.',\n 'The material that this bakeware is made of is carbon steel, and the non-stick, latte-colored coating looks very pretty and does the job well.',\n 'A thing that I didn’t like about the construction of this set is that everything is so bulky.',\n 'It is not a huge issue, but folks who lack storage space will not be thrilled with these products.',\n 'As far as items are concerned, the set includes two loaf pans, two cake pans, two cookie sheets, two pie plates, a muffin tin, and a plastic cake pan topper.',\n 'In my opinion, this is more than enough, but I’m sure some folks are going to be disappointed because there’s no pizza pan included.',\n 'The handles have silicon grips attached to them, and this is a big bonus when it comes to practicality and handling.',\n 'Also, the rolled edges allow you to grab the pan more easily and move it around securely.',\n 'The pan can withstand heat of up to 450 F, and I think that this should be sufficient for most baking jobs.',\n 'Make sure not to go over this temperature because you could burn the pans.',\n 'Copper has gained a lot of popularity in the cooking world over the last few years, and honestly, I can only say good things about it.',\n 'Copper Chef is known for a plethora of cookware, and now we are taking a look at their baking set.',\n \"As I've mentioned before, copper is a fantastic heat conductor, and the heat distribution in this material is as even as it gets.\",\n 'Personally, I find the latter feature very important because I like to have consistency in my cooking.',\n 'This is a 12-piece set that consists of a 12-cup muffin pan, a cookie sheet, a loaf pan, a square pan, and eight pieces of silicon ramekin cups with lids.',\n 'Ok, so I think it is a bit unfair for a company to advertise a set of twelve copper products while only four of them are actually made of this material.',\n 'While the ramekin cups are lovely, they seem to be a cheap filler in this set.',\n 'As far as handling is concerned, most of the products in this pack do not have handles, so you have to rely on the rolled edges for gripping.',\n 'This is a big disadvantage in my opinion, and greatly handicaps the ease of use.',\n 'These black, sturdy-looking baking dishes remind me of old-school bakeware sets that people used to bake with a few decades ago.',\n 'However, this is a modern and versatile set that should fulfill most of your demands.',\n \"The ChefLand set is made of carbon steel; it looks pretty plain but has a non-stick coating that's quite effective.\",\n 'One thing that this material is good at is even heat distribution, so you won’t need to worry about hotspots.',\n 'The products are dishwasher safe, however, after several months of kind of cleaning, some items started to form rust on the outer edges, which is a big minus.',\n 'I would recommend washing them by hand.',\n 'When it comes to the items, ChefLand’s set includes a roasting pan, a round pizza pan, a large and medium cookie sheet, two round cake pans, a square cake pan, a loaf pan, an oven crisper pan, and a 12-cup muffin pan.',\n 'As far as I’m concerned this set has everything covered!',\n \"Most of the dishes have handles on them, and even those which don't, have a nice grip area that allows for good handling.\",\n 'Unfortunately, there is no silicon padding or protective surface so you will need to use gloves or cloth.',\n \"This bakeware set comes to us from Sunbeam; it is a bit smaller set in terms of the number of items in it, but a worthy addition to today's list.\",\n 'Oh, I forgot to mention it’s cheap as chips!',\n 'The material these pans are made of is carbon steel, and its non-stick features are achieved with a xylan coating interior and exterior.',\n 'The black color gives it a pretty plain, non-exciting look, but I personally do not mind this.',\n 'The Sunbeam set has only 5-pieces, which is significantly less than other sets we reviewed today.',\n 'The dishes included are a loaf pan, a cookie sheet, a 6-cup muffin pan, and two round cake pans.',\n 'One disadvantage of this set is that it cannot handle temperatures higher than 400 F, which is quite limiting because some recipes require more heat.',\n 'All of the pans have handles or enough room to grab them properly and handle safely.',\n 'Now as I was reading some online commentary, many people complained that pans arrived dented or bent when they ordered them, so this might be an issue.',\n 'I haven’t experienced this myself, so I just want to put it out as a warning.',\n 'This set differs from others I reviewed today because it is the only one that’s not made of metal.',\n 'Boxiki Kitchen brings us this 3-piece silicone set that bread and cake lovers might find interesting.',\n 'As I’ve said, these products are made of silicone which has its pros and cons.',\n 'The good thing is that food will just slide out of it, but it might be irritating when trying to wash it by hand because it’s so bendy.',\n 'A lot of people raise concerns about chemicals in this material, so you’ll be glad to know that this set is FDA approved and non-toxic.',\n 'The set comes with three items – a round cake pan, a square brownie pan, and a banana bread/meatloaf pan.',\n 'All of the dishes are equipped with metal handles which allows for a nice and solid grip, so you won’t have to worry about the pans slipping out of your hands.',\n 'Silicone is generally oven safe up to 500 degrees F, which is fantastic and much better than some metal products, so you won’t need to worry about burning your bakeware.',\n \"However, the metal handles don't seem to take high temperatures very well, and I've heard some reports of them flaking and bubbling at 400 F.\\nI hope that the article was helpful and that it got you acquainted with the basics of bakeware.\",\n 'Now, the time has come for me to declare my top pick of the day, and the product that got most of my sympathies is Rachel Ray’s 10-piece Cucina Set.',\n 'Its beautiful design is what attracted me to this bakeware set, but the excellent performance made an even stronger impression.',\n 'Non-stick surface does its job flawlessly, and the carbon steel construction is sturdy and strong.',\n 'This is a very good list, i have tested myself the Rachel Ray’s 10-Piece Cucina Bakeware Set and i’m satisfied with it, it fulfill most of my daily cooking.',\n 'Are film trailers spoiling movies?',\n 'In April we asked if high ticket prices were ruining your visits to the cinema.',\n 'Yes, you said overwhelmingly.',\n 'But something else has put a strain on my relationship with the cinema – and it’s not the popcorn.',\n 'Have you ever gone to your local cinema to watch a new film only to feel you’ve seen it before?',\n 'I know I have.',\n '‘Spoilerific’ film trailers are now often so detailed it seems hardly worth watching the movie itself.',\n 'Imagine if the trailer for Casablanca told you whether Ingrid Bergman went off with Humphrey Bogart or Paul Henreid at the end.',\n 'Or if the trailer for Citizen Kane revealed just what the dying man meant when he muttered the word ‘Rosebud’.',\n 'And it seems that even some film directors agree.',\n 'Colin Trevorrow, director of new film, Jurassic World, has said he think that trailers have shown far more of the film than he would have wanted.',\n 'In the last couple of months, I’ve paid £17.50 a ticket to see two films I’ve been anticipating for some time.',\n 'OK £17.50 sounds steep, but that was for iMAX 3D and I’d still have paid more than £10 for a ‘normal’ ticket.',\n 'But I left the cinema unfulfilled, because I felt like I’d seen them both six months before.',\n 'In both cases the trailer revealed the entire structure of the story, key plot twists and expensive action sequences.',\n 'Throw in a few character deaths for good measure and you’ve got the basis of a significant chunk of what you’ve paid your money for.',\n 'I really did feel cheated by what the studio had wanted me to see in advance.',\n 'So is this just a modern trend?',\n 'I checked out trailers for 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1964’s Goldfinger to get a bigger picture.',\n 'Both revealed some well-known scenes (including Goldfinger’s iconic laser and dialogue), but the plot basics were instead explained by voiceover, rather than any especially huge visual giveaways.',\n 'Besides, the chance of actually seeing these trailers was significantly lessened due to the technology available at the time of release.',\n 'Which got me thinking further.',\n '‘If you don’t like it, don’t watch it’, I hear you cry.',\n 'I wish it were that simple.',\n 'In the age of the internet, exposure has increased tenfold.',\n 'Marketing campaigns target social media and television, while the days of a simple poster are gone.',\n 'Why commission a still image when you can display scenes from the film on a screen in a station or other public place?',\n 'Not only that, but trailers are also forced upon you in the cinema itself before other films.',\n 'Without a blindfold and a soundproof booth to hide in you have little choice.',\n 'It’s not that I have a problem with marketing and ads.',\n 'But they’re spoiling the experience.',\n 'I don’t want to see all the best bits wrapped up into two minutes, six months ahead of release.',\n 'Have you had a film spoiled by its trailer/marketing?',\n 'Is Hollywood revealing too much in a desperate attempt to put bums on seats?',\n 'Do ticket prices ruin your film-going experience?',\n 'Something George mentioned earlier about Terminator 2 trailer jogged my memory about another film from the same franchise, Terminator Genisys.',\n 'To promote the film, a trailer had been released that included a major plot twist ACTUALLY in the trailer.',\n 'Now, I had heard about this trailer and had been purposely avoiding it.',\n 'However, even when you try to avoid spoilers, sometimes it’s out of your control.',\n 'When I went to see Mad Max, they showed the afore-mentioned trailer and before I realised, it was too late.',\n 'It cannot be unseen.',\n 'Even the director, Alan Taylor, was unhappy about the spoilers in the trailer.',\n 'Genisys was [spoiler alert] ….. indeed half of the inspiration for this convo.',\n 'I saw that article about Alan Taylor’s thoughts the other day, but could only sympathise so much as the film was, in my opinion, a travesty.',\n 'Have you seen the film now Ryan?',\n 'If so what did you think of the big ‘reveal’?',\n 'For a film that had very little else going for it that really did completely spoil the experience for me.',\n 'I just can’t understand why that decision was taken.',\n 'You don’t need to resort to something like that to generate interest – if said twist is that good then word of mouth will spread.',\n 'For anyone interested, the trailer for the new Bond film was released today.',\n 'UNStudio has joined forces with HPP Architects to create a consortium (UNS + HPP) to carry out the next phases of their winning project at the architectural design competition for FOUR Frankfurt.',\n 'Take a look at the complete story after the jump.',\n 'From the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Groß & Partner real estate development company – who will be carrying out the development of the project – back in 2015.',\n 'Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years.',\n 'Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt’s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground.',\n 'The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation.',\n 'The choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt’s shopping district to the east of Roßmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage.',\n 'With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents.',\n 'The new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstraße into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site.',\n 'According to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value.',\n 'The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages.',\n 'The existing block on the Junghofstraße will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility.',\n 'This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels.',\n 'Four Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023.',\n \"▲Students are shouting several slogans to guarantee the school's autonomy in front of Jogyesa Temple.\",\n 'On April 15th, 2016, the General Student Council and Student Council of Postgraduate held the 4.15 Jogye rally.',\n

breaks my heart in two.',\n 'I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray.',\n 'Mostly it’s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me “Grandma”.',\n 'I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.',\n 'Where does Grace come from?',\n 'Everyone seems to want a brighter smile, and teeth whitening is a great option for boosting your confidence.',\n 'If food and drinks have stained your pearly whites, you may be tempted to

sit down dinner is for the married couple or for the married couple’s parents.',\n 'you know what i mean in a room of forty tables fifteen tables are for the bride’s extended family fifteen tables are for the groom’s extended family.',\n 'the remaining tables are either for friends of the bride and groom or to put relatives that no one really wants to acknowledge.',\n 'like that weird uncle who is starting to look more and more like his possessed chihuahua.',\n 'no matter what your guest arrangement you will need to find a hotel that provides a wedding package that fits your needs including your budget.',\n 'here is a summary of how much a wedding banquet will cost you this year.',\n 'do not expect most of the wedding invitations you receive this year to be held at luxury hotels.',\n 'while singaporeans do not seem to have a problem paying about e thousand two hundred per table prices per table have gone up so sharply in the past few years that e thousand two hundred is now on the low end.',\n 'if you are okay with picking a hotel that is a little off the beaten track then exchange convenience for comfort with a four star hotel.',\n 'do note that generally speaking these hotels have a higher requirement for the minimum number of tables you can request for.',\n 'though there are not too many three star hotels that provide wedding packages you are definitely going to save by holding your wedding at one of these hotels.',\n 'other than resorting to a three star hotel how do you get yourself a lower table rate?',\n 'there are many benefits to having a wedding banquet at a hotel like enjoying a complimentary stay in their suites and getting special rates for rooms for your family and helpers.',\n 'but with the rising prices of hotel wedding banquets these little extras just do not seem as worthwhile anymore.',\n 'consider having your wedding banquet at an alternative location.',\n 'country clubs like orchid country club and serangoon gardens country club offer table rates of at least seven hundred and ninety eight and seven hundred and eighty eight respectively.',\n 'orchid country club’s package even includes a one night stay in their bridal suite so there is no reason not to choose it over a hotel.',\n 'paying for a wedding banquet is no small sum of money so you might as well get something out of it.',\n 'citibank credit cards and uob credit cards usually have exclusive wedding promotions with certain hotels and restaurants.',\n 'alternatively you can just choose a good air miles credit card to charge your wedding banquet to and use the miles you have earned to pay for your honeymoon.',\n 'this one seems like an obvious suggestion since for several hotels banquets on saturday have their prices marked up by at least e hundred per table.',\n 'that is savings of at least three thousand to four thousand alone by not having it on saturday.',\n 'but price really is not the only reason you should be considering having your banquet on another day.',\n 'think of how physically stressful a traditional wedding day can be.',\n 'for many couples the day begins ridiculously early with the bride getting made up and into her gown.',\n 'the men are not entirely spared either with the groom and his entourage going through the horrors of gate crashing and bridal games and the delays they often because.',\n 'then there is the wedding ceremony itself which can take up to two hours.',\n 'depending on how dramatic a wedding banquet gets the married couple may not even get to eat!',\n 'before the dinner is over the bride needs to at least have had a couple of outfit changes and also gone from table to table taking photographs.',\n 'so by the time the banquet ends late at night the happily married couple are often happy to retire to bed and i do not mean for baby making purposes.',\n 'by holding your wedding banquet on another day like sunday you not only have more time to celebrate but you also give yourself and your partner enough breathing

not big enough.',\n 'the best part is choosing a smaller hotel ballroom might actually save you a substantial amount of money.',\n 'smaller four star hotels offer a table rate that is almost half the price compared to other four star hotels.',\n 'for example for a saturday banquet the grand mercure along east coast road is about eight hundred and eighty eight per table and hotel royal along queen street is even less at five hundred and ninety eight per table!',\n 'a banquet at amara for forty tables would cost at least forty three thousand five hundred and twenty.',\n 'a banquet at the grand mercure for thirty five tables would cost about thirty one thousand and eighty.',\n 'just cutting fifty people off from your guest list could save you over ten thousand.',\n 'that is definitely a lot of money that you can add to your honeymoon fund.',\n 'plus you do not have to invite that weird uncle with the chihuahua from hell.',\n 'you can go to singaporebrides.com for the full list of wedding table prices.',\n 'also do note that these prices may not include service charge or seven gst.',\n 'what other tips and tricks do you have for couples planning their wedding banquets?',\n 'share them
