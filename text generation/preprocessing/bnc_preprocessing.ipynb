I brought you some wine.\",\n \"think we drank it all though didn't we? we made our way through. I think that was part of the problem the other day when you came home and said we were all giggling and everything we'd been drinking that wine and stuff.\",\n \"the first bottle of wine we had was like Hardy's or something and it wasn't very good so I just thought ah let's just get this over with so we can get on to the next one. mm have you tried the chutney? I think it's nice.\",\n \"I'm not entirely sure how it goes with this but. I was quite enjoying it but. I just quite like sweet things so.\",\n \"well sweet appley things. see I'm normally quite an anti-sweet kind of. I'm not into like chocolate or like.\",\n \"I dunno sweet chocolatey type things but apple pies and things. I get behind those. didn't you used to have a big thing for ketchup though ?\",\n \"have to try this. he'll eat it whereas I won't touch it. that's the only thing.\",\n \"doesn't go wild over it we don't have any all at all. yeah I don't mind like I'd I normally prefer like tomato purée in place of ketchup. no it's not no we have salt and sugar in it.\",\n 'I have like. we have a party. I have like tomato ketchup emergencies if I run out of tomato ketchup like if I make a fish finger sandwich for example.',\n \"and then you've got no ketchup. that's not as bad as the barbecue that we had though. we had a barbecue and there was no ketchup.\",\n 'like the condiments were all just missing. and it was er I think our friend who had been staying around like she just like she just drinks ketchup. that is like the sad thing about condiments.',\n \"and we had like this enormous thing and it was just. gone and none of us had noticed. oh well we've got all these burgers no ketchup what?\",\n \"shocking that is a little bit of a disaster. it was kind of a disaster yeah it didn't quite ruin the barbecue but people were definitely judging it harshly for us. they've got where did all of this food and alcohol but they don't have tomato ketchup what is wrong with them?\",\n \"it's an embarrassment. can get away without ketchup if you've got like plenty of other stuff instead though. there was not a lot of other.\",\n 'mm that is the thing. well it was an impromptu one it was a very impromptu barbecue. it was one of the ones that sort of comes together about like quarter to ten at a pub in summer and you go oh shall we have a barbecue now.',\n \"oh yes 's house. so really they couldn't complain too much I guess. I'm boiling is anyone else boiling shall I turn the heating down?\",\n \"I'm definitely not boiling. I'm just right. yeah all good thank you.\",\n \"I have got long johns on cos I was outside this morning singing and it was freezing so. I'll just take my jumper off. I have skiing socks on and just the most enormously warm slippers.\",\n 'ah yeah they look awesome. I need to get my slippers involved in a bit. I think that was pretty much the first thing I did when I got here.',\n \"and slippers good yeah. yeah you need them downstairs there's a cold marble floor. which is nice in summer not so much in the winter.\",\n \"how long did it take to lay that? er dunno really. I'm sure I was on the phone to you and.\",\n \"I've sort of forgotten. at one point and you were like we're just laying down the marble. and I was like marble?\",\n \"I remember now you were like. isn't that what they have in palaces? oh yep ha.\",\n 'where did you get them? the fountain of all good things. I found them they were kinda like seconds that have little chips in the corners and stuff like that.',\n \"it ended up being the cheapest flooring option out of all the things we were considering that were possible really as well. they're really thick slabs as well. well we wouldn't put cheap stuff.\",\n \"like twenty mil thick slabs. yeah they're so heavy like there's a tiny bit left in the kitchen for putting pans on stuff just feeling that like it's pretty bloody heavy. oh well your house ain't gonna go down.\",\n 'I could barely lift one like. a full size one. this is weird.',\n \"you're still eating. so are you. so are you.\",\n \"I know but. 's normally significantly further ahead than this. I'm only a little bit.\",\n \"but you had a tiny portion. ah that's what it is. I'm a little bit slower.\",\n \"I'm sure I think I was a bit of guzzler this time. I sstuck in to the wine as well. that's what it is.\",\n \"I take regular breaks for red wine. I'm liking a little orange tang on the edge. mm orange tastes like orange.\",\n \"I'm just liking the lack of bacon. don't worry there won't be any bacon. it has been a very rich sort of weekend.\",\n \"there have been a lot of. no it is Christmas so you're meant to have rich food at Christmas but. meaty time.\",\n 'only for a week. I have made some really rich truffles. that is nice wine as well.',\n \"thank you very much it's quite nice isn't it? so what was the conclusion with the wine thing should you pour it? cos don't know whether you and doing like double blind trials or something.\",\n 'about area and doing all this crap. weird like where you whether you poured it between things or not. so what was the conclusion?',\n \"I mean it does alter the taste. what's your honest conclusion now he's not here? I'll hold that.\",\n \"I mean it does alter the taste a little bit. but it's not always like it depends on how you like your wine basically. so it just changes it but not always for the better.\",\n \"it changes it. mm I mean like a professional winer person or whatever they're called. professional winer probably not the same er.\",\n 'erm they like. they would have it they would have it airing because the true flavour of the wine will be more aired than what you get when you first open that bottle. right so like what the manufacturers want you to taste is open aired.',\n \"well you can't think if you're having nice wine coming off small estates you're not thinking any more about what a like if you're having Jacob Creek or bullshit. like you don't worry about whether you're airing it or not. cos what they want you to have is just drunkenness.\",\n \"and then more Jacob's Creek wine I presume. but like when you're buying it off like a small estate like a small batch then yeah they would they would like you to take your time over your wine I'm sure and like air it a bit. and they can't do that for you like the wine is you know for whatever reason it necessitates being in this particular bottle shape or whatever.\",\n \"so what so if that's the case why are the bottles like that? why d'you not have like a big like screw top of it yeah so it can like? it should have with a big neck yeah.\",\n 'since then having to decant it into a thing. though maybe the metal would be oh cos but screw tops. or just giant corks.',\n \"just really big corks. giant bung things. well I'm sure there'll be more corks though.\",\n \"the cork's like the vulnerable thing isn't it? that's like the thing. I suppose that's the bit yeah that.\",\n \"so the smaller that is the better in a way. but then there's the whole thing about selecting the cork for certain permeability and all that and like getting all that sort of finely honed so that it. yeah is that a real one this time?\",\n \"I'll have to show you upstairs cos you've gotta see their bath. the bath itself is not very exciting old scummy you know. there's more important things in the bathroom.\",\n \"I'm quite jealous of anyone with a bath we don't have one in our house. just have a shower. we never use it.\",\n 'yeah when was the last time? you could have a bath though if you wanted to. you had a bath?',\n \"at more than two years ago. yeah we didn't have one in two years. just feels weird having baths in other peoples' baths though.\",\n \"maybe three years ago. it's true. it's not is it not it just is it is a bit weird?\",\n \"that is a bit. well cos we're looking after well we're not looking after but we're going round to check our friends' erm house while they're over here. just is weird in general.\",\n \"they they're worried about their boiler not working so. and they said oh yeah you can have a bath if you want because they've got this like high epic bathtub that's in the middle of this big bathroom kind of thing. oh yeah one of those.\",\n \"they've just got into this new house and stuff but it's just like it's not that appealing. especially as their house is really cold at the moment cos they're not there. but in any case it's just a bit sort of weird.\",\n \"having a shower seems fine like it's like yeah. I can have a shower it's just fine but a bath's just so much more. it's a bit more of a project as well isn't it?\",\n \"and it uses lots of water and you probably wanna. once you've got it like you've gotta be stay in there for a while and that's a bit weird round someone's house isn't it? it is yeah.\",\n \"though if they're not there it's not so weird. but then that's also a bit weird too. like when you're round somebody's house.\",\n \"yeah it's weird though you're thinking it's not weird because it was weird but since they're not there it. it's time yeah. also like just being around somebody else's house even though you've been asked to look after like I would always be suspicious that other neighbours would be thinking there's a burglar in.\",\n \"there's a burglar in taking a really long bath. I don't think he was taking a bath especially if it's in the middle of the room. yeah but I mean if they're that observant neighbours.\",\n \"that was observant. they would recognise our van or they would recognise us because. we're round there quite a bit.\",\n \"either way it'd be pretty hilarious if the police arrived and you were just lying in the bath. yeah just like. I'm in.\",\n \"yes officer were you here for a dip? the water's just fine. well like for my birthday the other day.\",\n \"and the sort of like promise of having a go in their outdoor bath it's like. it's just kind of like got a fire underneath it. they've got their fire underneath it.\",\n \"and they're out in the sticks and you can see the stars and stuff really well from there. that is quite cool actually. but it's still a bit like well we'll have to like go from the house and.\",\n \"go out and have a bath and come back and. you see that's but that's. that's more of a like.\",\n \"no that's okay but. no like a look like it's not like you're going to get clean it's just like. going for this experience so it's a bit better really.\",\n \"but also that's very much like I could get down with that because I like that's very similar to like what you do in an onsen in Japan. and you'd actually like clean yourself in an indoor shower whatever and then you'd go out there. so you would go out there butt naked but that is perfectly socially acceptable.\",\n \"and the way to do it culturally in Japan. and like hot tubs are just baths with bubbles aren't they? be more than happy to go in those.\",\n \"I think though like if you're ever in a hot tub with other people if you just turn off the bubbles then it's just a bath with your friends and. yeah but that's normally their swimming costume and stuff though isn't it? gets weird really quickly I would imagine.\",\n \"and the sort of tepid water outdoors it. they're normally like you'd be in a erm like a swimsuit for that wouldn't you? yeah whereas like an outdoor bath thing I would go in naked.\",\n \"not if your mates are there to be. well no but in Japan you do. I wouldn't mind if I would.\",\n \"but like they wouldn't be watching us anyway would they? I hope not. that would be quite weird if they were.\",\n \"I hope not. they'd be standing at the side with a towel. but I dunno.\",\n \"like neither of us really like getting pruny and that seems to happen like within two minutes of being in a bath. so it's like well we've gone to all this effort building a fire like making it all like this and like. maybe you need to build yourselves up.\",\n \"maybe you need to start some training in your bath. before we go. I'd much prefer sitting in a sauna nice and dry and hot.\",\n 'two baths a day. I prefer a steam room to a sauna. jump in cold.',\n \"the air's all like muggy and dirty and weird and like you feel clogged up and like can't sweat properly. see in a sauna I find it a bit too dry. no it's good.\",\n \"and you can chuck water on if it's that dry. I don't really like either. I think I've been put off both of them just by my gym and just going in and it's just full of big hairy sweaty dudes and.\",\n \"then it just yeah that's not nice. that's just not how I like spending my. whatever time it is so.\",\n \"that's a bit weird I've never been into one like at a gym or something that'd be weird. no that's the only one only time I have like access to them. you should see some of those spas.\",\n \"no there's a great one at dance camp like. just like mainly nice and then you just run out into the cold showers run back in cold showers mm ah. I do quite like that actually.\",\n \"jumping in between the pool and it. like I've been to some like there was a festival I went to the festival and they'd made like an old horsebox. into a sauna.\",\n \"that was quite cool but erm. see I find like I think going in water or somewhere steamy naked is like a bit better than being like butt naked in a sauna. why cos it's.\",\n \"yeah I can see that. it's very much just like. but it's dark in there.\",\n \"I can see how that would be a bonus. but it's dark in saunas. limited visibility is possible.\",\n \"it's not like it's not like really light in a sauna it's quite dark. it's not like close. it's as least as light as this in most saunas.\",\n \"no not in the one that I like going in. but in any case even if it was light like I mean it doesn't matter. no it just depends who you're sharing the sauna with.\",\n \"I mean if it was weird gym guys. it's just weird. obviously but you wouldn't go in there.\",\n \"no also it's not just yourself it's more like the people who are like in there as well who are like looking at you. it's just a weird dynamic in general. no that's what I mean weird gym guys.\",\n \"especially the old ones the ones that stand around naked change most of the time. but like in a kind of like environment where most people sort of recognise each other and like it's all fine. it is yeah.\",\n \"I think one of the best hot tubs I ever went in was the muddiest as well. but you can also cooch up and stuff so they can barely see you if you're worried about your bits. cooch up cooch up.\",\n \"what did you say? cooch up like. you know you can sit like this can't you?\",\n \"like with your. yeah that's really natural and enjoyable. you look really like relaxed there.\",\n \"make you feel a lot more comfortable. just sit cross like this. she's can't bend her knees that low.\",\n \"well I suppose if you've got a problem you just don't go in there do you. yeah I suppose not really. so and then.\",\n 'I could be so mean in that situation so I could move you could be sitting there. and just chuckling every now. make them really paranoid.',\n \"at one of the obstacle races that we did they had this like giant communal hot tub thing. and like there must've been about fifty odd people in there. must've really dirty and stuff.\",\n \"and it was just like it was so well you finished and you're just covered from head to toe in like just mud and just horrible stuff. and it was just one of the greatest ones ever cos everyone was just so relieved to be out of the cold and out of the mud into this. they didn't care about the big lumps of poo and stuff.\",\n \"sort of floating around there. obviously a bit of horse poo coming along there. don't wanna know what it is.\",\n \"what's that? so it was warm. yeah it was warm hot.\",\n \"they were like they were blowing like some bubbles in it. but they were. it wasn't really worth looking it was like.\",\n \"your grubbiness was probably killing the bubbles wasn't it? yeah it didn't have the strength to get through the water. I thought you were gonna say they were powered by farts rather than like.\",\n \"there would've been an element of that. a lot of people eating a lot of protein and carbohydrates to get through the race. and like apparently what you could do.\",\n 'it was good though. it was very relaxing. would be the best of poos.',\n \"at least it doesn't smell too bad. to be in a bath with yeah. I'd wanna be in with them.\",\n 'if you have to choose any poo to be in like. I think of all poos. yeah definitely like yeah a horse poo.',\n \"sheep wouldn't be too bad I think. oh no no. how solid it is I think.\",\n 'well same with the horse. yeah well horse poo. no I think.',\n \"think that's always gonna be a plus isn't it? the solidity of it.

I've got all weekend to do that. yeah we could do a presentation of the presenting the present.\",\n 'the presentation of the presenting presents. you got a Powerpoint prepared for that? er I would like to keep the same.',\n \"well that happens to a lot of people I didn't used to like sprouts until suddenly we needed to cook sprouts. well like the when you sauté them. them up and sauté them with like garlic and or an onion.\",\n \"how are the sprouts? how are the sprouts are they acceptable? oh I'm loving them.\",\n \"I don't sprouts I really don't like sprouts. but these really are. er the Christmas ones were sort of alright-ish I guess.\",\n 'I tried them. but these are quite nice. we were just saying like.',\n \"kinda taste like poo which is good. yeah we were just saying mm the sprouts were okay because you didn't have to avoid them on the plate like. so it was quite good.\",\n \"these in as soon as they're like even just a smidgen overdone. well that's what was saying I just didn't. we overdone them at Christmas Day like.\",\n 'I think we did. did we overdo them? they were edible but.',\n \"but they weren't like. but only like a gravy and hidden yeah. yeah you need lots of gravy.\",\n \"but I didn't at least I didn't do loads of them so that we didn't have to have loads of yucky sprout leftovers. the only time I cook them myself is if you sort of chop them up really finely and sauté them with like onion and garlic. and then they're really nice.\",\n \"I'll send you. sprout curry is okay. mm again I think like that would just overdo her a bit.\",\n \"cos curry needs cooking a long time.

I'm pretty suspicious of smoothies. if you're in a rush.\",\n 'I have to say. suspicious of smoothies? too sweet too sweet.',\n \"I just like chewing things if it. doesn't like I dunno it always seems like food I dunno. got teeth for chewing and.\",\n \"I like smoothies for like the opposite reason cos you don't have to chew them. smoothies just like weird somehow. so I will have all of my vegetables for today in these next three gulps.\",\n \"it freaks me out drinking food. it's like odd. it is a bit weird it's a bit like baby food.\",\n \"but I just quite like I just see it as like ah it's a healthy drink. there is something weird about like you know. as long as I have water afterwards cos it burns my teeth.\",\n \"cos really digesting a smoothie because if you don't make the chewing with your mouth like does your body know that you need to react differently to that smoothie than just like oh that's water? I see it as like you know you've done the chewing in the blender. there's a bit of saliva missing.\",\n \"but it's okay for me to eat. no I know but don't. but not too.\",\n \"isn't there like a reaction in your body where like when you chew like which is why you you're supposed to chew a certain amount? but like if you don't chew like the mechanical action of chewing sets off enzymes and stuff in your stomach and that doesn't it? er well I like.\",\n \"only a bit. to an extent but I think just getting food in your belly just does the same thing anyway. no that's true.\",\n \"yeah I don't think it does I it does something the saliva I mean that's the whole process. well maybe it's best to have a smoothie when you're also eating food. and therefore it shouldn't be viewed as like replacement food it's just a drink.\",\n \"a slightly lumpy smoothie that you have to chew. but I often make those cos I get bored of blending and it's so loud that you have to chew my smoothies anyway like. yeah you're right.\",\n \"well the last one I had was rather was really nice though. if you have frozen stuff in it as well that doesn't quite. my friend's been on erm this thing called Soylent I don't know if you've heard about it?\",\n \"it's very soily. named after Soylent Green yeah. it's not that you poo the bed every night.\",\n \"yeah he's been pooping a lot erm no it's just like a food replacement thing sort of like er sort of like a Weight Watchers type shake except. oh right like smoothies all this shit? but it's like fully nutritionally balanced.\",\n 'so you could live just off this thing instead. just on that? ah how soulless.',\n \"erm there've been people doing I know but like for a lot of people don't like cooking and they don't like the effort. or they just don't do it so they just end up having. yeah so he eats like a couple of meals a week.\",\n \"and all of the rest of his meals are milkshakes and he's been on that for about three months and apparently the first couple of weeks were a little bit weird and his body was adjusting to. like going from eating actual food to just having liquid all the time. ah go on.\",\n \"and now he just feels like better than ever like he's just. energised he does loads of exercise and. apparently there's a lot of people saying this as well and I don't.\",\n \"think it would be for me but I think. yeah I can see the attraction for people like. but it's probably quite good if you're in a bit of a rush like just to get in a healthy meal.\",\n \"I can see how. some if people are like that and they don't like cooking and they don't particularly like eating like mother. like if mother was on her own.\",\n \"she would totally need that otherwise she just would like not eat anything at all. but I would just be like ah the things that I look forward to would just be this crappy milkshake. apparently it's not the tastiest thing.\",\n \"oh no that's even worse though if they can't even make. it's a bit sort of chalky and. that's gonna taste like some sort of indigestion medicine or something.\",\n \"no nope. I just know that's not for me but. it's saving him money it's saving him time and he's getting more vitamins and nutrients than he would do like otherwise.\",\n \"I'd like to think healthy yeah. mm like it makes lots of. yeah fair enough for that kind of person.\",\n \"try and attempt to try it. bit suspicious of like someone coming up with like the ultimate nutrition thing in general really. or like sort of being able to pre-empt everyone's kind of needs in a way.\",\n \"yeah because you can have a complete like range of all the nutrients and stuff but that might you might be a bit different. well people are different but there's different sort of things for different people in different lifestyles but. I'm not that suspicious it it's.\",\n \"but like on a day to day basis you do change like what you need like and like other days you just you know. yeah true but a lot of people just eat the same thing every day anyway or just eat Mcdonald's or just eat whatever so I mean. that's true.\",\n \"Mac yeah yeah. if you're having not much anyway. yeah if you're like having rubbish anyway.\",\n \"I find it hard to believe if you're having like a proper healthy diet then it would be better than that or as good as that. I can't believe that but. yeah I mean chewing is kinda cool.\",\n \"I'm with you with the chewing. just like quite nice. yeah I like it and I like.\",\n \"I'm not. cooking as well and like. creating something tasty.\",\n \"that's good. I went to see it's a nice sociable thing as well. instead of just like a grey liquid.\",\n \"like that what we've just done I mean you like how much fun would this be if we all had just a glass of like chalky liquid in front of us? well instead you might be like playing board games or you might be. well we can have that anyway I would imagine.\",\n \"er perhaps socialising or you might be but yeah you could get like an extra hour of it or something. it's true. which is his argument.\",\n \"which I don't agree with. sort of instinct. can you pass that water please?\",\n \"but he is also so I mean. yeah right so yeah. oh god oh he's been talking about that to me for ages like.\",\n \"yeah he's finally gotten some of it. last Christmas I believe he was going on and on. where was he at Christmas by the way?\",\n \"er he didn't come. doing all those things he can do now. oh yeah we had all the food but he doesn't eat food any more so it wasn't really for him.\",\n \"d'you want some water ? no thanks I'm good. that's it like.\",\n \"what do you do though if someone invites you in for dinner you're like? yeah I see the. well no he does still eat sometimes and he goes out.\",\n \"for meals and stuff it just. means that he's spending his money on like he'll go out for like a nice meal once a week instead or something. and doesn't spend any time cooking.\",\n \"well that's quite nice. saves on the washing up. it saves on the washing up as well.\",\n 'you could get rid of all like your plates and bowls and. yeah just glasses. just need a glass.',\n 'kitchen get rid of your kitchen. you could have another room. you could have an whole another room.',\n \"the benefits are becoming apparent. where's your kitchen? I don't have one but I do have my hot tub room.\",\n \"come and drink smoothies with me. yeah I'm tempted to just I'm gonna check it out I think I don't I'd definitely not be doing it all the time but I definitely wanna see what it's about and. you have like a busy week and don't have time you say.\",\n \"I'll just have this grey liquid and. tell me about grey. grey sort of colour.\",\n \"now that's a weird colours. it's not like it's not it's not a good colour it doesn't look like a healthy colour. yeah man grey.\",\n \"sort of beigey grey. grey's just not a good colour for any food. no not really.\",\n \"I'm trying to I'm trying to think of a grey food now and. see but you can see how like like. I imagine in my lifestyle like I could very easily like say that I don't have time to cook.\",\n \"like every single day but it's. actually really healthy for me to make time to cook. not that it has to be for everybody but I just think like for me I could very easily if there was something quick that I could use like that to not cook I could easily fall into that as like a bit of a trap.\",\n \"yeah you just work or? it's an important like break in my day to like. cook and eat and stuff I don't know.\",\n \"you see sometimes I'm just like at the office I'm like this is the only thing I've got to look forward to. I'm getting hungry. what about money?\",\n 'that means I have to go okay then I can make dinner and have a break. and then I can do some more work after dinner so yeah. yeah well thank you very much for that it was really good.',\n \"lovely thank you. that's more vegetables I think in one meal than last week the food that we.
