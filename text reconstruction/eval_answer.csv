1587,could be worse you could have sand in your vagina. that is true. that is true are not it.

2180,they do not they the french do not. the french women i have seen do. well they have no hair are not they.
2181,i am not really very happy about it. i think it needed to come to an end. well i suppose it is true.

2186,that would be horrible. now you are gay. just hope hitler does not come back from the dead.
2187,ah what is block. thought was that it. what is that block.
2188,yeah they were reliable. yeah they were just a lot less safer. so a bit of water.
2189,we have all bonded. oh that is nice. is not it.
2190,cos that will be totally devoid of any sun. that is right yeah. anyway let us the sun is.
2191,oh it is snowing. yeah it is. that is very cool.
2192,for a little while. but if you look at the rooms. we are getting there.
2193,do i want to help you with that bit. this chunk of meat. it is a massive chunk of meat.
2194,to shuffle some paper. it is ridiculous. let us see what is open in.
2195,how is this. how has this happen. is there not another menu button.
2196,cos they did not want it to be. shown any more. like now because that is become so like prevalent.
2197,it is supposed to be really good. in what kind of way like. i do not cannot really remember eddie the eagle did he always lose.
2198,yeah why not. it is all good. is that two of the clock.
2199,he is never been he is never been. i have never been to the other place either but. i have never been to any of them.
2200,what are you going to do. smash that whole cupboard. you need to buy you a hammer.
2201,could it be church. there might be a service on easter saturday. i do not really know.
2202,it feels like a lot longer than that. that is the sign of a good year. yeah i think so.
2203,it is like the watch shop. is it in. you did not take to the garage.
2204,it is yeah. that you rise through the ranks. every chief constable in the land at the moment.
2205,the clutch thing kind of comes. quite naturally now. but not changing gears.
2206,which is a bit weird. maybe it is er haunted. i mean it is very nice.
2207,expensive yeah exactly. it is expensive is not it. yeah it is like.
2208,the one with the. then you just. they were lovely were not they.
2209,yes it is very good. very good you have got some nice bits in it. i feel quite strongly about it.
2210,that is what i thought but it is not apparently. the girl with the pearl earring. it is almost.
2211,he could have. if he did not. he could have been a successful basketball player basically.
2212,well this is the. so why did not he bring her where did he. bring her back to.
2213,and who is that. is that you. so it is.
2214,he is a big character again. no direct flights from birmingham. where have we got to go from then.
2215,i think so yes. mm no i am a bit in two minds about whether. you should put years on cards.
2216,that is the wings. that is the top. what is that.
2217,no it is. usually it will say. it will either say.
2218,bring the bread. bring the bread through. bring the bread through.
2219,that kind of thing. so it really makes sense to have that kind of. yeah fair enough.
2220,but i do not think we could with your travelling cost. the travel costs would be like the cost of the living. there is i still have a loan.
2221,explain that again. it is a glue. it is a glue.
2222,i cannot tell these two i want to say that is again but. so yes that is the plan. that is right yeah.
2223,but you would not be stopping in this one for long i do not think. what you looking at. he is being a bit lazy.
2224,what is he doing. this was the plan all along. are you coming in.
2225,well they were not really expensive were they. even good groups and. no they were not.
2226,no it was good. well you have been before have not you. it is er.
2227,this sort of black um. cos it is quite protective. actually in a way.
2228,yeah that is right. anything yeah it would not really matter. yeah but we are not very good.
2229,another one for and this one. is that it. have you got a new one mum.
2230,they do not look like dragons. no they are absolutely tiny. dragon though do they.
2231,that is annoying. a good singer is not she. and all of this.
2232,not on your own. not on my own. and that it is not just the deposit.
2233,anyway she is. i forgot how noisy that one was. that was awful that was.
2234,it is like really. yeah they are a bit worried. it is like the cuckoo in the nest is not it.
2235,do you want to put that back in the bag. no i do not love. bang and the dirt is gone.
2236,and just behind the guildhall there is a water trough are not there. there is an old. the old where the taxi rank is.
2237,that is fine. er yes that will be fine. where is she busy.
2238,er as in cos i will not be able to drive. for six weeks so. yeah course i would.
2239,you did not enjoy the penis. but you are smarter for having watched it. i do not believe that you did not enjoy the penis being.
2240,that is paired yeah that is paired free generally. oh yeah that is what i mean rather than dancing. although the dancers do kind of.
2241,i can smell popcorn. i can smell eggs. i can smell the blood of an englishman.
2242,with all those armies. it is a tough one. which country are you going to invade now.
2243,i was like agreeing with you. i agree with you. a lot i do i do.
2244,there is got to be something about making it look nice. is not there. or are you not bothered.
2245,the actor one. no he was not a bouncer he was not. so was nothing stolen.
2246,so how is everything going at work. is it all ticking along nicely. yeah it is got a bit quiet at the moment.
2247,and where are the holiday inns situated. oo oo. what are you doing.
2248,so now they all really like her. and she is just changed now she used to be so much nicer. has she really changed.
2249,i have got that hair really blonde. it is much patchy but i have got the moustache waxed. hold it in place.
2250,have you had any onion rings. i have had two. i have had three.
2251,what does actually do. i do not know. the do you think she just drinks.
2252,it is really dry and dense. it is not a. it is lemony.
2253,i will not end up in plaster. what is this. what is this.
2254,when i was younger. that would be when i was younger i think he is probably. he came to.
2255,could we walk there. might be a bit far to walk. or it is actually.
2256,i do not know if it is like. i have been on three hen nights. you were with uh there.
2257,how about the thermostat. i would definitely go with a new thermostat. kind of a x antique.
2258,which would have been. twelve days late. and she was not.
2259,are they i am sure they are the skinless ones are not they. no i could not find. any skinless ones this year.
2260,then i walked out. stole an album from him. wait so what do you do.

2267,i do not do the lottery either. that is going to be. very out of the question at the minute.
2268,oh i would be like fuck off. you would be like no would not you. a thirteen year old.
2269,you would certainly be looking out of the window would not you. of course you would. so their priority is the tv not the life and nature outside.
2270,it was one of those things. that was easy. i do not know if i could pass a maths paper now.
2271,it actually a sort of recognised mental illness. i have i can go weeks without speaking to anyone. apart from work.

2286,how sarcastic was that. no it was not sarcastic. it is quite exciting.
2287,but i do not know he is fifty one now. and really that is not a good age to be looking for another job. i do not think he will really get anything to be perfectly honest.
